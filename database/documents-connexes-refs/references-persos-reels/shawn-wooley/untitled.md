- *Project Title**: "Madotsuki_The_Dreamer"
- *General Creative Vision**:

In "Madotsuki_The_Dreamer", a psychological thriller, we delve into the complexity of digital and real identity. This film, diving into the depths of reality versus perception, unveils the impact of internet culture on individual identity, as well as the alarming consequences of social isolation and negligence. Adopting a fragmented and immersive narrative style, we blend live-action shots, captivating animations, and striking visual effects to paint the tumultuous landscape of Joshua's online world.

- *Plot and Characters**:

At the heart of the story, Joshua Ryne Goldberg, a bright but troubled young man, navigates through a maze of radical online activities. Key figures orbit around him: his overwhelmed parents, a determined FBI agent, an elusive online mentor, and journalists in search of truth. The film, like an introspective journey, follows Joshua's transition from isolation to extremism, offering a mirror to the dangers of online radicalization.

- *Creative Inspirations and Influences**:

"Madotsuki_The_Dreamer" draws from the narrative richness of masterpieces such as David Fincher's "Zodiac", "A Scanner Darkly", and "We Need to Talk About Kevin". It is also inspired by the world of video games, particularly "Yume Nikki", and Japanese animation classics like "Akira" and "Ghost in the Shell".

- *Visual Approach**:

The cinematography, oscillating between reality and animation, reflects the multiple facets of Joshua's life. Represented as an avatar, inspired by Madotsuki from "Yume Nikki", he evolves in various virtual worlds, symbolizing the different spaces of online forums. These diverse universes highlight the fragmentation of his identity.

- *Ideal Casting**:
- **Joshua**: A versatile actor like Timoth√©e Chalamet, capable of embodying Joshua's emotional complexity.
- **FBI Agent**: An imposing actor like Denzel Washington, representing authority and determination.
- **Online Mentor**: Joaquin Phoenix, embodying an enigmatic and manipulative charisma.
- *Sound and Editing Treatment**:

The soundtrack, playing on contrasts, will accompany the inherent duality of the main character. A fragmented and intelligent montage will merge virtual worlds, real sequences, and archives, in a style reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's works, for a complex and captivating narrative.

- *Creative Objectives**:

With "Madotsuki_The_Dreamer", we aim to immerse the viewer in the psyche of an "ultimate troll". The film initiates critical reflections on digital lives, misinformation, and the construction of nihilistic personalities. It is a quest to understand how art can sublimate the darkest impulses of humanity.
