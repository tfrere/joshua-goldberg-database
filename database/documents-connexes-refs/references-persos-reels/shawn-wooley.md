Shawn Woolley, born on February 12, 1980, was a personable and good-humored young man from Hudson, Wisconsin. Despite challenges like ADD and grand mal seizures, Shawn was known for his kindness and good grades in school. His love for video games began early, with favorites like Doom, Pac-Man, and Mortal Kombat 2. As an adult, Shawn worked at Domino's Pizza and was promoted to assistant manager. His life took a drastic turn when he started playing EverQuest, a highly addictive MMORPG, in 2000. This game, developed by Varant Interactive and Sony Online Entertainment, was known for its engaging graphics, immersive music, and extensive social community.

Shawn's addiction to EverQuest rapidly grew, leading to significant changes in his behavior. He stopped socializing, visiting family, and even quit his job at Domino's due to the game. In July 2000, he experienced his first seizure in over 13 years due to excessive gaming. By September 2000, Shawn was evicted from his apartment for not paying rent and had to move back with his mother, Liz Woolley. Despite therapy sessions, his addiction was not recognized as a problem by therapists.

In December 2000, Liz had Shawn stay at a motel temporarily. In January 2001, he was placed in a group home as part of a long-term support program. Despite showing signs of improvement and securing a job at Papa Murphy's Pizza, Shawn's addiction continued. He even left his brother's wedding early to play EverQuest. His condition worsened, with frequent seizures and declining personal care.

In August 2001, Shawn bought a used computer, supposedly for his Microsoft certification, but used it to play EverQuest. By October, he was working and playing the game constantly, having cut off most communication with his family. On November 20, 2001, Liz found Shawn dead in his apartment, sitting in front of his computer with EverQuest on the screen and a hunting rifle by his side. It was later revealed that he had purchased the rifle on November 13.

Following his death, Liz Woolley worked to spread awareness about video game addiction. She founded Online Gamers Anonymous in May 2002 to help others struggling with gaming addiction. Liz also considered filing a lawsuit against Sony Online Entertainment for their role in Sean's addiction. She eventually gained access to Sean's EverQuest accounts and discovered a character named "I Love You," indicating Sean had romantic feelings for someone in the game. This discovery suggested complex emotional factors contributing to Sean's addiction and eventual suicide.
