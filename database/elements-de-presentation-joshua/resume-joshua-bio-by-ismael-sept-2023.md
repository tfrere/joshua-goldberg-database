# Résumé Joshua Bio by Ismaël sept 2023

Here is a chronological summary of the key events related to Joshua Ryne Goldberg's case, along with a psychological profile based on the information provided:

## Early Life and Background:

- Joshua Ryne Goldberg was born on May 14, 1995 in Jacksonville, Florida. He was adopted as an infant by Frank and Rebecca Goldberg.
- He lived on 3119, Pine Rd., Orange Park, Florida, until he was arrested
- From an early age, Goldberg exhibited symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, including lack of social skills, difficulty interacting with peers, tantrums, and obsessive rituals and habits. However, he was not properly diagnosed or treated for autism until much later in life.
- As a child, Goldberg was bullied and ostracized due to his odd behaviors. He attended public school until 5th grade, when he switched to online school due to inability to cope with traditional classroom environment.
- Goldberg suffered from depression from age 11 onward. He was prescribed medications for ADHD and mood disorders as a child and teenager.
- Goldberg had no real friends besides occasional video game playing with a neighbor boy until age 10. He never dated or had a romantic relationship.
- Goldberg became reclusive and spent most of his time alone in his room on the computer. By his late teens, he was spending 14-20 hours per day online.

## Creation of Online Identities:

- Starting in 2014-2015, Goldberg began creating fictional online identities known as "sock puppet accounts" or "troll accounts" on various social media platforms.
- He created identities representing different genders, races, nationalities and ideologies, including both extremist and moderate perspectives.
- His main sock puppet account was "Australi Witness," posing as an ISIS extremist in Australia. He also created a moderate account called "Moon Metropolis" to expose Australi Witness.
- Goldberg's stated intent was to use Australi Witness to connect with real extremists online, obtain information about attacks, and share it with journalists via his Moon Metropolis account to gain fame as a reporter.
- However, Goldberg also admitted to provoking arguments online just to get attention and cause "chaos." He created dozens of contradictory accounts for this purpose.

## Escalating Online Extremist Rhetoric:

- In early 2015, Goldberg began communicating with journalists in Australia as Moon Metropolis, claiming he had insider information on attacks from Australi Witness and other ISIS accounts.
- The journalists were intrigued at first but became skeptical over time as Goldberg was unable to provide verifiable evidence of real terrorist plots.
- In mid 2015, an anonymous account called Media Direct began threatening to reveal Goldberg's real identity online.
- After this, Goldberg began making increasingly provocative extremist statements as Australi Witness, presumably to make the account appear more legitimate in case he was exposed.

Contact with FBI:

- In July 2015, an FBI confidential informant contacted Goldberg posing as an extremist interested in carrying out attacks in the U.S.
- Goldberg (as Australi Witness) responded enthusiastically and began providing the informant with information about making explosives.
- Over the next few months, Goldberg gave specific instructions about building a pressure cooker bomb and discussed targeting a 9/11 memorial event in Kansas City in September 2015.
- Goldberg was arrested at his home in Florida on September 10, 2015 and charged with distributing information relating to explosives.

## Psychological Profile:

- Goldberg has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and major depressive disorder. His communication and social deficits are consistent with autism.
- His extreme social isolation, dependency on online relationships, and inability to distinguish reality from fantasy online are also typical features of autism.
- However, his longstanding depression and feelings of worthlessness appear to be the main drivers behind creating elaborate online fantasies to gain validation.
- Despite his deviant online behavior, Goldberg does not appear to be inherently violent or malicious. He has no history of harming others.
- With proper treatment and support, Goldberg has the capacity for empathy and contributing positively to society. But his severe mental illnesses clearly contributed to his unlawful online speech.
