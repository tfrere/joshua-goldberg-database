Intervenant 1
Before we begin, we wanted to let you know that this episode contains graphic descriptions of violence and strong language. Some portions of the episode are dramatized by actors.

Intervenant 2
So in April 2015, a fake Facebook account was set up in my name.

Intervenant 1
This is Elise Ortega. She's a journalist based in Sydney, Australia. And back in 2015, I've been involved reporting on ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, trying to figure out how the group was enticing Western teenagers to join their cause.

Intervenant 2
And the person who set up his account was using it to chat to a young Islamic preacher called Junaid Thorne, who back then had links with Islamic states supporters. I interviewed Junaid Boon previously and I just so happened to be chatting to him from my real Facebook account when he asked me why I was contacting him through another account.

Intervenant 2
I was like, What is going on?

Intervenant 1
Puzzled. Elise searched for the other Facebook profile.

Intervenant 2
It had my name. It had a photo that this person had obviously stolen from my other Facebook account.

Intervenant 1
It was a picture of Elise standing outside somewhere cold. She's wrapped up in a warm coat wearing a beanie hat, but there was nothing else. The posts of photos, the profile had been created hours ago.

Intervenant 2
The account had one friend, someone who was using the handle app. Moon. Metropolis.

Intervenant 1
Moon. Metropolis. It sounded like some kind of cipher.

Intervenant 2
I think I was probably just curious at that point. You know, maybe quite naively, I didn't see it as anything dangerous. It was more just a feeling of, you know, who is this person? And what are they doing? How dare they?

Intervenant 1
At least felt her journalistic curiosity tugging at her. But she had no idea that on the other side of a screen lay in intricately constructed funhouse mirror maze where nothing was quite as it appeared. Eventually, Elise would get to the center of that maze and confront its architect, a shapeshifting figure, an Internet troll out to cause chaos in the real world.

Intervenant 1
From some angles, seems like a misunderstood human being. Desperate for acceptance, but from others too dangerous terrorists. All of which Elise would only discover much later on.

Intervenant 1
I'm David Harewood and this is counter-terrorism. An audible original. Throughout my career as an actor. I played several intelligence and counter-terrorism chiefs and I became fascinated with all the details of how this stuff actually works. So in each episode of this six part series, I'm looking at the incredible stories behind some of the world's most dangerous terror plots and how they were disrupted.

Intervenant 1
Through them, exploring the reality of counter-terrorism work, a secretive and often messy world that most of us never get to see. In this episode, the story of Moon Metropolis. When at least got pulled into Moon Metropolis World in 2015, ISIS was seen as probably the world's scariest terrorist threat.

Intervenant 1
In 2014, they started building their radical and restrictive Islamic State across Iraq and Syria. They called it the caliphate. At its height, it covered 40% of Iraqi territory and a third of Syria and Iraq. ISIS capitalized on years of political instability after the 2003 US led invasion in much of the country. They were able to overpower the dysfunctional coalition backed Iraqi military one in Syria.

Intervenant 1
The Arab Spring Pro-democracy protests triggered a civil war in 2012, leading to ISIS vying to fill the vacuum of stable government. Back then, it seemed like there was no stopping them. And by this point, ISIS had also developed a sophisticated online propaganda machine. They flooded Twitter and other social media sites with brutal videos of attacks and killings. For example, in August 2014, a video of American journalist James Foley's beheading spread around the world.

Intervenant 1
The media strategy successfully radicalized sympathizers across the globe, some of whom decided to make their allegiance to ISIS known by carrying out attacks at home while others traveled to Syria and Iraq to support ISIS. In building that caliphate instead, governments the world over were writhing in a panic about the boogeyman ISIS recruitment. At least, Pottinger says that it was no different in Australia and that Australian news outlets were obsessed with tracking down radicalized ISIS recruits.

Intervenant 2
Basically, every newsroom, every journalist, every editor was looking to find these jihadists. You know, they wanted the kid who'd grown up in Sydney, the kid who'd been educated in Australia, who came from a loving family, who then suddenly thrown it all away and joined ISIS.

Intervenant 1
Elise was looking for that story, too. That's why she was talking to Junaid Thorne, the preacher with links to young ISIS supporters, which is when that fake Facebook profile in her name caught her attention. And she couldn't figure out what the person behind it was up to. So she decided to use her real Facebook account to send a message to the doppelganger.

Intervenant 2
I said something along the lines of nice profile pic. I remember that day well, and as soon as I sent that, they took the account down.

Intervenant 1
So then she shifted focus to that one friend fake Elise had made on Facebook in Metropolis.

Intervenant 2
And what I found online was this person had published a bunch of blog posts promoting a free speech agenda.

Intervenant 1
Here is some of what Moon Metropolis wrote constantly.

Intervenant 3
I find it nothing less than absolutely disgusting and depressing or completely clear in the campaign. Or she writes or so opposed to the most basic human right, the freedom of speech.

Intervenant 2
So, you know, I was like, Oh, that's interesting. You know, who is this mean Metropolis person advocate for free speech? Still very curious about why they would be trying to set up a fake Facebook account in my name and interact with Junaid Thorne.

Intervenant 1
Elise kept digging around and found a Twitter profile with the handle Lune Metropolis. The profile photo was the same as the Facebook accounts.

Intervenant 2
Just a photo of a kind of like an anime style cartoon image of a young girl.

Intervenant 1
She's wearing a pink hoodie, but her eyes are squeezed shut. The image is cutesy and a little childish.

Intervenant 2
So I reached out to me Metropolis via his Twitter page. I think I said, Hey, we meet again. We live in Metropolis, replied. And he confirmed that he'd set up the fake Facebook account in my name. And he also admitted to setting up a fake Twitter profile engineered Thorne's name. And I was like, What is going on here?

Intervenant 1
None of it made sense, but Elise kept asking questions.

Intervenant 2
He said that he had an interest in extremism and that he had been using this fake Junaid Thorne Twitter profile to chat to Islamic State supporters and that he had screengrabs of some of these conversations and these Islamic State supporters were planning to carry out attacks.

Intervenant 1
Again, Elise found this really strange. Moon Metropolis had answered her question of what he was up to, but the answer didn't make much sense.

Intervenant 2
He presented it as he was trying to do some kind of research.

Intervenant 1
Elise Afternoon, Metropolis. If she could have a look at these conversations. She was a journalist covering ISIS after all.

Intervenant 2
So he emailed me the Screengrabs.

Intervenant 1
Here's a conversation between Moon Metropolis pretending to be Junaid Thorne in conversation with a would be ISIS supporter.

Intervenant 3
What have you been up to? Have you joined the Mujahideen in Syria?

Intervenant 4
Oh, yeah. I'm working for amnesty. Right now.

Intervenant 1
And here is Moon Metropolis using his fake Junaid Thorne account, talking to another ISIS supporter.

Intervenant 3
What was the organization you said you donated so much money to, by the way?

Intervenant 5
I've got these human rights laws, and so they're working on prosecuting.

Intervenant 4
anti-Muslim hate speech. So I think there's a cartel spread.

Intervenant 1
Kofar means nonbeliever in Arabic.

Intervenant 2
As I read these chaps. There was just something about it that struck me as being really odd, just did not add up. It was like these Islamic State supporters would suddenly just chuck in, Oh yes, I worked for amnesty and oh, I've donated money to the Human Rights Law Center, which just didn't seem like the kind of thing that a real diehard Islamic State supporter would say in a chat with another Islamic State supporter.

Intervenant 2
I mean, he just it just felt really weird.

Intervenant 1
Elise started doubting that Moon Metropolis was pretending to be just a generic phone in these conversations.

Intervenant 2
You know, if that account's fake, why couldn't any of these other accounts be fake?

Intervenant 1
It seemed to Elise that Moon Metropolis was playing the parts of all the ICC supporters in these screenshots.

Intervenant 1
She'd just experienced her first moon Metropolis Smoke and mirrors show. It was a lesson learned to take nothing Moon Metropolis said at face value. And while she still wasn't sure what exactly the goal of this performance was, there was a common thread in the fake messages. Moon Metropolis was trying to smear human rights organizations by drawing associations between them and ISI's supporters.

Intervenant 1
Perhaps it had something to do with these organizations threatening free speech in Moon Metropolis in mind. But all these were just guesses. The uncertainty was sucking Elise further into the mystery.

Intervenant 2
I spent a lot of time stalking these jihadist accounts on Twitter and Instagram in between my other work. And, you know, I was keeping my friends updated on this as well. And we were kind of laughing about it, saying, bad mean, who impersonates a journalist like rule number one? Should they never fake the account of a journalist because they're going to come after you?

Intervenant 1
But it wasn't the only one getting pulled into this strange world of online illusions. The wider Australian media were also falling into the rabbit hole, even though they didn't realize it yet.

Intervenant 2
Around this time there was another Twitter account that was attracting a lot of attention that used the handle Ash Australia weakness. These Twitter profile said I'm.

Intervenant 6
A of.

Intervenant 3
Use.

Intervenant 2
And you know he had the ISIS flag up there is his photo and he was posting some pretty inflammatory stuff. Retweeting Islamic State posts calling on young Muslims to join the fight to go to the caliphate. He'd actually called for a doctor in the US to be killed.

Intervenant 1
Australian witness also tweeted, inciting an attack against an Australian cartoonist, Larry Pickering, infamous for being openly homophobic, misogynistic and Islamophobic.

Intervenant 4
Rather, subscribe to our newsletter. Pickering has known the Prophet as an MP who lives in Queensland.

Intervenant 2
On the face of things. You would take this account as the account of someone who was a diehard Islamic State supporter. Someone who's in a position of recruiting or encouraging young people to join the Islamic State.

Intervenant 1
And a lot of reporters in Australia were taking the bait. Talking to Australia witness the same way as Elise had been talking to Junaid Thorne.

Intervenant 2
There was a time when using social media as a source to contact people for interviews was relatively new and in terms of verifying how real these accounts were, you know, I don't think there was as much due diligence going on.

Intervenant 1
At least, admits that ordinarily she wouldn't have necessarily questioned the authenticity of the Australia witness account either. But after her bizarre experience with Moon Metropolis and what she believed to be fake ISIS supporters, she knew better than to take anything she saw online for granted.

Intervenant 2
There were these lines that I could draw between the Australia witness account, the screen grabs of these jihadists who were chatting to the fake Janet Thorne account and Moon Metropolis account.

Intervenant 1
Elise thought that she was starting to understand the full reach of Moon Metropolis online presence. But then he threw her another curveball in April 2015.

Intervenant 2
The Times of Israel had published this inflammatory blog post under the name of Joshua Bornstein, who is a very well-respected Melbourne lawyer. And this post, it was horrible. It basically called for this swift and merciless extermination of all Palestinians. And of course, when it was posted, Josh Bornstein received a whole lot of blowback.

Intervenant 1
It was a typical aggressive social media pile on. Bornstein was being called psychotic, genocidal. He was receiving death threats. The public revulsion was as fervent as the blog post was vile.

Intervenant 2
The thing was, Bornstein had nothing to do with this post, and he was saying this publicly. Someone had stolen his identity.

Intervenant 1
You can probably tell where this is going.

Intervenant 2
When you look back at when the Times of Israel Post was published and you look at the first person who tweeted about it. That person was named Metropolis.

Intervenant 1
The timing of Moon Metropolis, his tweet majorly suspicious that he might have impersonated Bornstein, too.

Intervenant 2
When I saw that, my mind was just blown. Suddenly he's done this other thing that's totally unrelated to Islamic State but is horrible in an entirely different way.

Intervenant 1
And Metropolis, his.

Intervenant 5
Fingerprints were all.

Intervenant 1
Over the place. But what was he really up to?

Intervenant 2
I guess in my mind I was thinking maybe Australian Witness Mean Metropolis. They must have some connection with Islamic State in some way. Maybe it's one of these 18 year old kid in a bedroom obsessed with ISIS. You know, that's where I kind of made Metropolis and Australia witness. And then after the Times of Israel hoax and after I'd connected that with me in Metropolis, I just felt really confused.

Intervenant 2
It just didn't make sense that this one person would be playing these extremely different opposing personas.

Intervenant 1
Basically ruin. Metropolis was trolling. But it started to look like he was trolling indiscriminately. And as she wants the fallout from his stance reverberate, Elise began to realize that the invisible hand of loom metropolis typing away somewhere in the world, had potential to cause real damage.

Intervenant 2
This person was okay with causing harm in the real world and didn't really care about the human consequences of it. So it took things to a new level.

Intervenant 1
A bigger and much more baffling picture was now emerging. He was a troll who was obsessed with free speech, who smeared the identities of people from all ideological and religious backgrounds, who had somehow faked his way into becoming a huge player in the Islamic extremist online space. Someone who wielded a great deal of influence in dangerous circles and actually watched his online trolling grow more brazen.

Intervenant 1
At least began to get worried.

Intervenant 2
I was like, Right, I need some help with this. I need someone who's kind of a nerd who can get on the dark web or something like do some like fancy stuff on the Internet.

Intervenant 5
My name's like Anon and I'm an Australian journalist.

Intervenant 1
Even playing the title himself. But other journalists have called Luke a troll hunter before.

Intervenant 5
I mean, it's maybe factually accurate, but I don't like it myself.

Intervenant 1
Luke grew up on the Internet.

Intervenant 5
I've always been involved in, I guess you'd call online communities. You know, I think I was ten years old when I got my first modem.

Intervenant 1
He started hanging out on Internet message boards in all kinds of weird pockets of the Internet in communities of trolls, hackers and other shady online characters. And he became comfortable in that world later. Luke became a freelance investigative journalist and made tracking down unsavory Internet personalities, his specialty.

Intervenant 5
I mean, I used to joke that I can find anyone online.

Intervenant 1
So when Elise emailed him in 2015 asking him for help investigating a mysterious figure who was playing with fire in some of the most dangerous corners of the Internet, he immediately wrote her back.

Intervenant 2
It was like a one line response to my long ten page email. He's like, This is excellent. I'm going to need some time to digest this.

Intervenant 5
I spent about four or 5 hours just reviewing the material. They said to me and going on a bit of a deep dive, and I found it incredibly curious, like, what is this person doing? It was almost like a puzzle and it was bugging me and I'm like, I have to get to the bottom of it now. I have to resolve it.

Intervenant 1
Luke was in. He teamed up from opposite sides of Australia.

Intervenant 2
We kind of started to work in tandem. I'd already gone through the front door as a journalist with Main Metropolis. At the same time, Luke would essentially step into his world as a troll and talk to him as someone who knew that world and was part of that world.

Intervenant 1
Luke decided to go straight to Moon Metropolis. He sent him a direct message on Twitter, confronting him about the Joshua Bornstein hoax. Troll two Troll.

Intervenant 5
I'd started off by putting to him that I knew that he'd done it essentially. And how much would the subject pay to have him served up and put him on provocative terms?

Intervenant 1
Luke didn't think it was a good idea to ask him in Metropolis whether he was behind the hoax because he could have easily denied it. Instead, Luke made it sound like he already knew that Moon Metropolis had done it for a fact, and he was kind of impressed. But to get Moon Metropolis, his attention, Luke needed to use language that would make him sound trustworthy.

Intervenant 1
Trustworthy to a troll, that is. And so he said, How much do you think the lawyer ju would pay to have you delivered up? Like I said, Troll two, Troll and Moon Metropolis took the bait instantly.

Intervenant 5
It worked. It worked. Probably best to take this off Twitter.

Intervenant 1
Then Metropolis wrote back to Luke and invited him to take the conversation to Internet Relay chat.

Intervenant 3
Maybe online or C.

Intervenant 1
It's a messaging platform which Luke says is pretty popular with neo-Nazis, online trolls and the like. Once there, it didn't take long for Luke to get his first confession from Moon Metropolis. Luke asked him.

Intervenant 5
How did you get the timetable? Is it that fuckin easy to sign up?

Intervenant 3
It's really easy. You just have to register for this Internet check.

Intervenant 1
Just like that. Moon Metropolis committed to Luke. He was behind the Joshua Bornstein hoax, and it was more.

Intervenant 2
He was posting on a neo-Nazi blog as a guy called Michael Slate.

Intervenant 5
Who I knew anyway.

Intervenant 3
Michael Slate was smaller. I have several multi accounts on Reddit.

Intervenant 2
He'd impersonated a left wing human rights activist, Tanya Cohen.

Intervenant 3
How did you know.

Intervenant 5
The power of my mind alone?

Intervenant 2
An Australian activist, Caitlin Roper.

Intervenant 1
Roper is a women's rights activist and Moon Metropolis used Twitter to spread transfer content in her name.

Intervenant 3
And bathroom before Twitter makes it harder to use a lot of pressure to change. After my last stop.

Intervenant 5
You are stumped.

Intervenant 1
On and most importantly, Australia witness.

Intervenant 3
I'm just feeding bullshit to the media because anything I fucking realizes people.

Intervenant 2
Luke sent me a message. He was like, We've got him, you know, He's admitted to it.

Intervenant 1
Luke just nudged Moon Metropolis and he burst with confessions. He seemed desperate to talk about all his different characters with someone. As the two chatted over the course of a few days. MOON Metropolis was revealing more and more of himself to Luke.

Intervenant 5
He had a distorted, angry view of society. He saw things like Wokeness as a kind of disease.

Intervenant 1
Talking to Moon, Metropolis started becoming a huge part of Luke's life.

Intervenant 5
I was up to four or 5:00 in the morning. It was like I traveled back in time to my teens.

Intervenant 1
The two developed a strange and kind of intimate connection. But Luke didn't get any concrete explanations. For what Moon Metropolis was trying to achieve. It seemed to him like the person behind the screen was just enjoying themselves.

Intervenant 5
My take on it was that it was giving him sort of a domain hit, you know, like I've done hoaxes in the past, some pretty successful ones as well. It's kind of addictive.

Intervenant 1
But around this time, Moon Metropolis started doing something much more dangerous than just online hoaxes.

Intervenant 2
There was an exhibition planned in Garland, Texas, and it was going to feature cartoon images of the Prophet Muhammad and a star witness put up a post on Twitter calling for people to carry out an attack at this exhibition.

Intervenant 1
He actually retweeted a tweet from another ISIS supporter account saying, Brothers in Texas, please go there with your weapons, bombs or with knives. In the Islamic tradition, it's forbidden to depict the Prophet Muhammad in any way. He's a revered figure, and drawing him in a satirical context is often seen as extremely offensive. Australia witness seemed to be trying to provoke an attack similar to the 2015 shooting at the Paris offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, when two extremists killed 12 people in retribution for the magazine's publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.

Intervenant 1
But Australia Witness wasn't just retweeting. He also posted a map showing the exact address of the place where the Garland, Texas exhibition was going to be held.

Intervenant 5
Kaphar was drawn to 110 Garland, Texas, on May 3rd. Page spread to us brothers.

Intervenant 1
Luke decided to confront the metropolis. He asked him.

Intervenant 5
Are you not at all concerned, by the way, that some of these jihadi nutcases might actually kill someone at your base?

Intervenant 3
These guys are pussy warriors.

Inconnu
Welcome to CBS This Morning.

Intervenant 5
We begin with a deadly shootout in Texas outside.

Intervenant 2
On the day of the exhibition, two young Islamic State's supporters turned up.

Intervenant 5
Police say officers killed. Two gunmen opened fire after driving up to the event in Garland, Texas.

Intervenant 2
Australia Witness later claimed that he had inspired the attack by these two young men, so he wanted to claim that he was responsible.

Intervenant 1
This was a typical ISIS inspired plot, not a huge theatrical attack. Just two guys deciding to enact terror in the name of ISIS. After messaging with ISIS preachers and recruiters on Twitter figures in the same online circles in which Australia Witness was so influential after the attack attempt was disrupted. Luke couldn't believe what he was saying.

Intervenant 5
I'm watching it in real time. Pretty horrified.

Intervenant 1
A message to move Metropolis about it.

Intervenant 5
He tells me that he was interacting with one of the people that were actually killed and he's because I like it. For him, it was an eternity like the fucking right. He mentioned something like, Look at that, idiots. I guess that's when I was like, Wow, this guy's not just a curiosity. This guy is actually a menace.

Intervenant 1
But at this point, as far as Luke and Elise could tell, authorities still weren't paying attention to Australia. Witness even after Garland, Texas, the account seemed to be carrying on, as always. It seemed like it was up to them to do something about the threat he posed because they felt that if they didn't, he might do something similar again.

Intervenant 1
And maybe instead of just jumping on the bandwagon of an attack already being discussed next time, it would incite an attack of his own.

Intervenant 2
In the weeks after the Garland, Texas, attack, Luke and I both realized that there was kind of an increased urgency to work out whom in Metropolis was.

Intervenant 1
So one evening, Luke released, settled in for a sleuthing all nighter, determined to get to the bottom of Moon Metropolis. His real identity.

Intervenant 2
It was so late I was lying in bed with my laptop, and I think I had Luke on the phone.

Intervenant 1
Luke decided to start combing the Internet for any record of Moon Metropolis that they may have missed before. And he got a hit.

Intervenant 5
We found an OkCupid profile. It had been deactivated, but it was still photo that.

Intervenant 2
Small, blurry photo of a young man's face and a buyer that read.

Intervenant 3
Well, it was Joshua. And I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm a college student who takes online classes.

Intervenant 4
I'm also a columnist who writes about politics, criticizing both sides equally.

Intervenant 1
The profile seemed like an earnest attempt for Moon Metropolis or Joshua Goldberg at finding a relationship. And the profile also included a location. But it was nowhere near Australia.

Intervenant 5
At least in Orange Park in Florida.

Intervenant 1
For the first time in weeks. Elisa Luke felt like they were finally piercing through the inner layers of the moon metropolises distorted world.

Intervenant 2
Just like we can't stop, we can't stop looking to keep going. And I kind of on a whim, searched for a list of registered voters in Orange Park, Florida, and popped in Joshua Goldberg's name. And it came up with his full name and an address and also the name of his sister.

Intervenant 1
Overnight, Elise and Luke, a pink moon metropolis to a real identity. A 20 year old called Joshua Goldberg.

Intervenant 2
I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep too much that night. I was probably trying to look for photos of him.

Intervenant 1
And he's actually managed to dig out a photo of Joshua with his whole family.

Intervenant 2
It's his sister's graduation, and he's got this long curly hair, framing his face down to his shoulders. And he's smiling and he's standing next to his parents and his sister. Very much a happy family photo.

Intervenant 1
It was a huge breakthrough, but at least heart felt victorious.

Intervenant 2
It was kind of tainted by this feeling of, you know, this is a guy who has a family. They probably have no idea what he's been doing and would probably be really devastated. It could only be a sort of sad, tragic ending, really.

Intervenant 1
Luke was wrestling with his own conflicting feelings about Joshua Goldberg to now that they had a profile of a real person in front of them. Luke realized that in a way, even Joshua was perhaps not all that different.

Intervenant 5
I mean, there were periods of my teen years and early twenties where I wouldn't see daylight for weeks. I think that's my initially I had sort of a soft spot for him.

Intervenant 1
But Luke wasn't losing sight of his mission. He still needed Moon Metropolis himself to confirm his identity.

Intervenant 5
I said to him, I know exactly who you are. And he didn't believe me. He was that overconfident.

Intervenant 1
So back in troll mode, Luke decided to have some fun with Joshua. He looked up Joshua, his parents Florida house on Google Maps.

Intervenant 5
Nice house, Big pool, beautiful area. And Orange Park. And I'm so joking to him. Can I come in? Swim in your pool with Florida? Great weather like Olsen. So he went into a mad panic. He was really upset that I'd found it, but then kind of just went on talking to me.

Intervenant 1
In a strange way. Joshua seemed to still trust. Look at this point. They'd been talking for a couple of months and Luke hadn't exposed him all that time. So Joshua probably figured that the secret of his real identity was safe. But soon, whatever sympathy Luke, or at least developed for Joshua, evaporated.

Intervenant 2
It all became a bit more serious, I think. In the weeks after the gallon Texas attack in early June, when I received an email from Australia Witness.

Intervenant 1
Remember, at this point, Joshua still had no idea that he at least knew who he was, that she was working with Luke, or that she knew that his moon, Metropolis and Australia witness accounts were connected.

Intervenant 2
And he said that he was instructing the Mujahideen in Melbourne and Los Angeles to carry out attacks. He told me that the Los Angeles Mujahideen already has a gun and the Melbourne Mujahideen is obtaining one as we speak. And he said that many Kufa will be slaughtered. That just hit me in the gut because any doubt that I had about the potential to cause harm in the real world had been thrown out the window.

Intervenant 2
You know, he could really be inciting terrorist attacks. I emailed Luke straight after receiving that email and I said, This is pretty fucked up. What are we going to do about this?

Intervenant 1
What made the whole thing more believable was that Luke had been hearing the same thing straight from Joshua.

Intervenant 5
Yeah. He was saying that he was in contact with someone in Melbourne who was going to shoot up a synagogue. And yeah, I started getting obviously pretty nervous. But then he showed me screenshots of their chats.

Intervenant 1
This time the screenshots seemed real.

Intervenant 5
The guy was talking about getting a hold of a weapon.

Intervenant 1
Elise and Luke realized that they were in way over their heads.

Intervenant 2
And that's when we went to the place.

Intervenant 1
Elise shared everything she and Luke found with the Australian Federal Police. But the police seem not to be very concerned.

Intervenant 2
They thought Australian Witness was just some kid in his bedroom in Melbourne trolling. And they didn't seem to think that was in any way dangerous.

Intervenant 1
This was maddening to Elise and Luke. They were convinced Joshua Goldberg would keep setting fires all over social media and happily. What's the burn in the real world?

Intervenant 2
I definitely felt that, you know, I might wake up and there might be a report of another terrorist attack and that it might be connected with Australian Witness as well.

Intervenant 5
But like a brother and brother.

Intervenant 4
I saw nothing about Chuckie. It's nice to talk with you. You got a kind of.

Intervenant 5
Famous slightly L.O.L.

Intervenant 1
On the 26th of July 2015 at 657 in the morning. Joshua, through his Australia witness account, received a message from someone he didn't recognize. The person seemed like just another one of thousands of ISIS supporters on Twitter gushing to their favorite influencer. Joshua seemed to relish the attention and a human, the guy really famous.

Intervenant 5
I read a news article after.

Intervenant 4
Garland and it had your name in it, so I said, Alhamdulillah, maybe we can chat.

Intervenant 1
But Joshua had made a mistake. He had become too careless because this person wasn't an easy supporter. They were a confidential human source, which is FBI speak for an undercover informant. And straight away. Joshua took this CHC into his confidence, unknowingly sealing his fate.

Intervenant 4
Yes, the foreign media did cover me after Garland. Right now I'm trying to get him, which I need in Melbourne, to carry out jihad. But he keeps doing it. He has a gun already. I'm afraid I'll get caught before he can do it.

Intervenant 1
Joshua was breezily sharing the plots he had in the works with this eager stranger. Meanwhile, on the other side of the conversation, an entire team was carefully crafting the informant's responses. They stood at the start of an intense and rapid investigation.

Intervenant 5
These cases typically take years. From the day that I received the case to his arrest was approximately 30 days.

Intervenant 1
This is Special Agent Jim Berry. He was in charge of the FBI's investigation into the Australia witness account.

Intervenant 5
I am task force officer on the Northeast Florida Joint Terrorism Task Force.

Intervenant 1
Jim works out of Jacksonville, Florida. According to Jim, Australia, witness emerged as a serious terrorist threat in the eyes of the FBI because of his to the failed Garland, Texas, attack in May 2015.

Intervenant 5
We knew that he had potentially already inspired a real attack. We also knew that he was very prolific at the highest levels within jihadi social media circles. And the urgency was the unknown. Who was he attempting to conduct? An attack?

Intervenant 1
After Garland, the FBI became worried that Australia Witness had gotten a taste for orchestrating mayhem and that he'd manipulate more racist supporters carrying out attacks. So at the end of July, the FBI decided to get close to him online by pretending to be a malleable follower, ready to go along with anything Joshua suggested with the goal of arresting him as soon as they could prove that he was willing to turn his social media chatter into real terrorist action.

Intervenant 1
It was a classic undercover sting, according to official files on the case written by Jim. By August, the FBI was able to link the Australia Witness account IP address to a house belonging to a Goldberg family. These files also suggest that the FBI opened their investigation into Joshua completely independently of the information that Elise and Luke shared with the Australian Federal Police a few months earlier.

Intervenant 1
Jim Berry even explicitly states in the document that, quote, I am not relying on any information provided by l m meaning Luke to the AFP for the establishment of probable cause. Though it's worth noting that Luke doesn't buy that narrative.

Intervenant 5
It was rubbish. It was complete rubbish. I thought it was kind of funny. I actually laughed because I was like, Oh man.

Intervenant 1
Luke thinks that it was legally simpler and less messy for the FBI to build the case against Joshua on their own, rather than relying on the work of two self-directed journalists on the other side of the world.

Intervenant 5
They definitely used my information as a base, but they certainly by yeah, they were all over it, which is fine. Whatever.

Intervenant 1
The FBI claimed that they only received the information about Elise and Luke's work from the Australian Police on the 4th of September, well after their own investigation was underway. In any case, the FBI had reached the same conclusions as Elise and Luke that Joshua was capable of real trouble.

Intervenant 5
We have an individual who is encouraging attacks against synagogue. The first thing that stood out was his name, Goldberg, as possibly being of Jewish descent. It didn't make a lot of sense.

Intervenant 1
In the meantime, the CHC stayed in touch with Australia Witness almost daily. At first, Jim says, the conversation was relatively benign. But on the 17th of August, Joshua escalated things. He and the source were discussing a destructive terrorist, ISIS plot in the UK when Joshua said.

Intervenant 4
Hopefully there'll be some jihad on the anniversary of 911. They can probably figure something out. That sounds good. Which is in mind. Jimmy voluntarily. I don't have any bones. I don't know how to make them suddenly.

Intervenant 1
Joshua was talking about making bones. The FBI sensed real danger now, and a few days later, things got even more serious.

Intervenant 4
All right, I care. I'm going to suggest the bomb making guides on Twitter sent by Sarah Jessica Law, Canberra. Let me know if you need any more, brother. I'll help as much as I can.

Intervenant 1
Joshua then sent the undercover FBI source bombmaking manuals, which explosive experts confirmed were authentic. Everything suggested that Goldberg was very serious about his plotting.

Intervenant 5
He kept pushing it along. How are things coming? How's the planning coming? Simultaneously. He was also very concerned with an individual in Australia who was supposed to be conducting an attack for him. This was such concern to the Australian Federal Police that they had police officers at the major synagogues in Melbourne. He was also attempting to have an attack done in the Los Angeles area.

Intervenant 1
Around this time. At least two could finish their reporting, but they didn't want to interfere with a potential counter-terrorism investigation and so they held off publishing the article for the time being. And because they recognized that, they'd waded into very deep waters with Joshua. They both decided to take a step back from talking to him that summer. But Joshua himself was still regularly reaching out to Luke.

Intervenant 5
He's messaging me every day almost, and I'm trying to ignore him, but he's sending me more and more stuff about being in contact with jihadis who know when.

Intervenant 1
And also about a new jihadist in the U.S..

Intervenant 5
He starts talking about how he's providing them instructions on how to make a pressure cooker bomb. I didn't really believe him. And, you know, I tell him to shut up shop.

Intervenant 1
But no matter what Luke wanted to believe, Joshua kept sinking in deeper.

Intervenant 4
How do you decide what kind of attack to carry out on 911 key? I was thinking about it. We can make pipe bombs and make them at a large public event. Yes, I'm leaning towards that too. I've been getting excited about this. What city are you in? Actually, we need to find the best place to place the explosive.

Intervenant 4
I'm in the Midwest. The closest place is Kansas City.

Intervenant 1
And just a few days after that.

Intervenant 4
I found the perfect place to go to Kansas City. Stare popcorn? Yes, that's perfect. I'm looking at it.

Intervenant 1
It was a 911 memorial event in Kansas City, Missouri, in which hundreds of firefighters climb stairs in honor of the first responders who'd rushed up into the falling towers. Goldberg planned for the bombs to rip through hundreds of volunteers and onlookers at the memorial. He seemed to be getting excited about this plot.

Intervenant 5
He really wanted to conduct an attack. He really enjoyed being able to control what others did from his keyboard.

Intervenant 4
When you go there, place the bomb. Make sure the bomb is very well hidden. Where do you think would be best near the firefighters or the crowd? You could safely. Mark put the backpack near the crowd.

Intervenant 1
As Goldberg's plot crystallized, the FBI decided they needed to take him down soon as they could. They began monitoring his home.

Intervenant 5
We had 24 hour surveillance on the house.

Intervenant 1
It was a two storey suburban home with a garage and a front yard. A picture of humdrum Americanness. Joshua lived there with his parents and siblings. A quiet life.

Intervenant 5
And he did not come outside. His parents would go to sleep. And when his parents went to sleep, you could see the one light come on in his room and you would see shadows on the other side of the window.

Intervenant 1
This was how the FBI saw Joshua Goldberg as a ghostlike presence haunting his parents house lights turning on in windows as he moved through it. Of everyone else had gone to bed during three weeks of a round the clock surveillance. The agents watching from the street only saw Joshua leave the house once.

Intervenant 5
He had gone to a doctor's appointment with his parents.

Intervenant 1
But it was enough to confirm his identity. And as the day of the Kansas City 911 memorial event approached, Goldberg's plotting was starting to look more and more serious.

Intervenant 4
And shards of metal and nails, actually. Okay, I'll get a bunch of screws and stuff, broken glass and probably work to just put as much sharp stuff as you can in there. If you can get the screws and other shrapnel and rat poison before putting them in that way. The confined to hit by them will be more likely to die.

Intervenant 1
It was serious. And alarmingly, the FBI had no idea whether Goldberg was cementing instructing other potential terrorists around the country. Jim decided it was time to finally take Goldberg offline. On the 10th of September, the task force was going to conduct a house search. If they found enough evidence. They arrested Joshua then and then that day, a squad of FBI and county sheriff officers cars converged on the Goldberg's suburban home while at that very moment, Joshua was still bragging to Luke about how his plotting was coming along.

Intervenant 5
Show me a photo of a constructed fucking pressure cooker like the FBI would have been outside his house at the time he was communicating with me.

Intervenant 1
It's unclear where Joshua got the photo. Was it sent to him by the FBI source or by another plotter, or was it just something he got off the Internet? But it illustrated to Luke just how far gone Joshua was at this point.

Intervenant 5
Looks like he's fucking.

Intervenant 1
As Joshua was still sitting at his computer. An FBI SWAT team poured out of their cars, not to the Goldbergs in a box towards the house and made their way in.

Intervenant 5
We made sure that we were actually talking to him through our just actively as we hit the house. So we knew he was on the computer.

Intervenant 1
The SWAT team headed straight for Joshua's bedroom. Jim arrived after the agents secured the house and Joshua, he was going to be the one to conduct the initial interview.

Intervenant 5
He obviously didn't expect us. He was basically in his boxers. We had to have him dress for us and put clothes on. He just sat there, sort of still not a lot of eye contact. Looked down at the ground. I took custody of Joshua and read his Miranda rights, and we proceeded to have about a three and a half hour interview at that point.

Intervenant 1
At first, Joshua was evasive, but then once Jim revealed that they knew all about his communications with the Kansas City plotter, Joshua realized there was no point in playing dumb any longer. He admitted that the Australia witness account was his, and he confessed to plotting the Kansas City attack. But he had an explanation.

Intervenant 5
His story was that he was an online vigilante and he was drawing these people out for the FBI, that he was doing all of this as a jihadist to pull people out in hopes that he could either a report them at the last minute or B, they would be killed like the Garland attackers.

Intervenant 1
This story made the case even more confounding than it already had been. What was going on in Joshua's head? Was he a calculating terrorist, grasping at straws, or did he actually believe what he was telling the FBI?

Intervenant 5
If you ask me today of his dozens of aliases, which one is the most accurate depiction of Joshua Kovar? I have no idea. Talk to you at all.

Intervenant 1
This is Paul Short. Steve.

Intervenant 5
I'm an attorney here in Jacksonville, Florida.

Intervenant 1
The Goldbergs hired Paul to represent their son pretty much straight after the arrest. Paul says The Goldbergs were, on the face of it, a very ordinary family. Both Rebecca and Frank Goldberg. Josh was parents were special education teachers. They lived in a modest but nice middle class suburban neighborhood with their four kids. The most unusual thing about them was that two of their four children were adopted.

Intervenant 1
One of them being Joshua The Goldbergs. Having spoken on the record about Joshua's case since his arrest, but representing their son. Their attorney, Paul, talked to them often as he was trying to piece together Joshua's story from a very young age. Frank and Rebecca recognized that their son struggled in social situations.

Intervenant 5
Once you get to elementary school easily, at that point, you're able to make friends, interact with teachers and classmates. Josh was never comfortable in an environment with other people, so he never had any friends.

Intervenant 1
Also, is that the closest Joshua had ever come to having a real friend was when he sometimes played video games for the boy from his neighborhood. But the boy stopped spending time with Joshua when they were ten. That was basically it in terms of friendships for him. Frank and Rebecca grew increasingly worried about their son.

Intervenant 5
The parents were trying to deal with that by getting him out to go to the Boy Scouts.

Intervenant 1
But the Boy Scouts idea had backfired. Paul sees that Joshua was teased and ostracized by the other boys.

Intervenant 5
You know, it just can't connect with other kids. You can't interact with them. And then the kids see him as some weird kid and they treat him poorly. And that's worse for him. And then he just couldn't go to school like other kids. It's really smart, but did not do well in school just because he just was not comfortable in that environment.

Intervenant 5
I recall the parents telling me that there were times when he was bullied.

Intervenant 1
Both being special education teachers. The Goldbergs started getting an inkling of why their son struggled so much in social situations.

Intervenant 5
They were pretty adamant that he was autistic.

Intervenant 1
And around the age of ten or 11, they realized that Joshua couldn't keep going to school. He came home at the end of each day miserable. He was already getting pushed out of society and growing resentful of it, so they decided to make a big change.

Intervenant 5
He had to just be out of school. So they did some online schooling for a while.

Intervenant 1
It meant that the bullying stopped, but also that he lost any last bit of social contact he'd ever had. And over the years, his parents watched him turn into the ghost. The FBI agents would years later observe from the other side of the street.

Intervenant 5
There were long periods of time when he would just be in his room, not even interacting with his family, other than come out, maybe eat, drink, whatever, go to the bathroom. And they didn't know what he was doing. I mean, they knew he was on the Internet. They just wouldn't see him. They just know he's in there.

Intervenant 1
Joshua's parents weren't exactly happy that by his late teens, their son's entire world had shrunk down to just his room and his computer screen. But they made peace with it.

Intervenant 5
They're like, look, the one positive about him being in his room on the computer all the time is that we know where he is. We know he's safe and we know he can't get into trouble. Which kind of ironic is the Internet Boy, can you get in trouble.

Intervenant 1
What his parents hadn't seen was that alone in his room. Joshua's views of the world were growing darker and But Paul thinks that Joshua's online activities were mostly just about getting attention for him.

Intervenant 5
We can just characterize it again as him being as controversial as he can be, because this is this is it for him. The Internet's his world and he wants to be able to communicate with people. And you don't do it by just having conventional opinions. You know, you don't do it by saying that Top Gun movie was pretty cool.

Intervenant 5
It's not going to get you a lot of clicks or likes or responses. So, you know his mind. He's got to do it by being as out there with radical free speech as possible to try to get the interaction.

Intervenant 1
As for the Kansas City plot, Paul says it's not clear what Joshua hoped would really happen.

Intervenant 5
I don't know if he really intended for it to happen. I know she intended to stop it.

Intervenant 1
But the FBI takes a different view. Jim says that their confidential source. I tried to give Joshua an opportunity to take it all back as the days of the attack was approaching. But Joshua just wanted to press ahead.

Intervenant 5
At one point, we expressed to the page, I'm uncomfortable with this. There are going to be children there. And Goldberg, as I was fairly witness, would encourage our kids. So don't worry about it. The firefighters are too far. It's adults. It's okay to go forward with the plan.

Intervenant 1
At least a little of both found out about Joshua's arrest from the Australian police on the day it happened. They were relieved that Joshua wasn't able to cause any real damage out there in the world, And they published their reporting that very day. After reflecting on Joshua's actions, Elise thinks that his isolation and social difficulties shouldn't absolve him from being held responsible for his actions.

Intervenant 2
There were a lot of people who had mental health issues who went to join ISIS and found some kind of community there, and they were the ones who were also inciting terrorism. Probably not so different to Joshua Goldberg. They just had a different outlet.

Intervenant 1
But still, there is the fact that it seems pretty clear that Joshua never intended to leave the comfort of his bedroom. This, his defense attorney says, makes it hard to label him as a conventional terrorist.

Intervenant 5
I don't think she's a terrorist. I think it is a terrorist case. Any time where you're literally encouraging someone to bomb an event without any indication that it's going to stop. I don't know how we can separate calling it terrorism, saying he's not a terrorist. I mean, it's just complicated.

Intervenant 1
Luke sees it differently.

Intervenant 5
I think, yeah, he's a terrorist. That's unequivocal. Like he was trying to get people to boy stuff up with a pressure cooker loan. But is he a terrorist in the classical sense that he motivated by some kind of ideological push?

Intervenant 1
This question of what Joshua really believed, it puzzled Jim Berry, too.

Intervenant 5
I don't know of any other time where a terrorist attack, multiple terrorist attacks were being planned by someone who did not hold that ideology. The entire thing was just a fake persona. Convenient mechanism for him to express his hate for the world, basically. And even though Joshua may have been pretending to be a jihadist extremist, he was still a terrorist.

Intervenant 5
He wanted a terrorist event to happen.

Intervenant 1
The US federal government charged Joshua with illegal distribution of bomb making materials and attempted malicious damage and destruction by an explosive of a building. And while normally, Paul says this kind of terrorist offense comes with a 20 to 30 year prison sentence, he was able to negotiate the prosecutors down to ten.

Intervenant 5
Certainly, they understand there's more to it than just some guy trying to commit a terrorist attack.

Intervenant 1
Joshua has autism, and his complex web of motives meant that the prosecutors were open to treating him gently. And even Paul admits that Joshua's profile, a young white man from a middle class suburban American family, worked in his favor.

Intervenant 5
If this was, you know, Mohammed from Jordan, who we could establish was mentally ill but is online trying to incite terrorist attacks, my argument that he's mentally ill, everybody maybe got me a year or two off from these twenties and thirties or would have been completely ignored.

Intervenant 1
It's worth noting that when Paul refers to Joshua's mental illness, he's talking about his autism. But medically, autism isn't considered a mental illness.

Intervenant 1
In 2019, while still behind bars, Joshua was able to publish a blog post under his moon Metropolis handle. And for what it's worth. In it, he maintains the defense he first gave Jim Berry straight after his arrest.

Intervenant 4
The public thinks that I'm a sick, evil Fluxus terrorist. While I may not be a paragon of virtue, I am not a terrorist either. In reality, it was my intention to infiltrate jihadist fears so that I could eventually become either a journalist and FBI agent. Both.

Intervenant 1
But he goes on to say that he, too, doesn't quite know what to make of his own story.

Intervenant 4
My motives are as tortured, befuddled and obtuse to me as they are to you. The best analysis of me was in the last place that you would expect in the thread about me on white supremacist form Stormfront. When the question was posed as to why I did what I did online, one user summed it up as follows The sun stirring things up and causing trouble.

Intervenant 4
I suppose. Rebelling against everything because he hates normal life and doesn't fit into it. There has never been a more accurate description of me than that.

Intervenant 1
Joshua's case brings together threads that we've been tracing this entire series on counter-terrorism from the rise of the Internet as a dangerous terrorist battlefield to the advent of Islamic and domestic terrorism being seen as existential threats to our societies and even the very fundamental question about the value of the label terrorist. Across the six episodes, we're told different stories of major counter-terrorism operations from the last three decades.

Intervenant 1
And even just over that relatively short time, the nature of terrorism itself, a shape shifted and fragmented into new forms. But its ultimate goal has remained unchanged. Here is Kaepernick evade a modern history professor and political violence researcher at the University of Sheffield, who you heard in our second episode about the I'll raise capital blackout plot.

Intervenant 2
Terrorism is designed to produce an emotional response in an audience. It's supposed to provoke fear and terror and outrage and anger. And you see that through how societies and governments respond to terrorism all the time.

Intervenant 1
And in large part, counter terrorism. Is that societal.

Intervenant 4
Response.

Intervenant 1
It's the result of policy and emotion. By defining who we are protecting ourselves against and how we do it, we aren't defining who we think we are and what our societies should look like.

Intervenant 2
It's always implies a kind of relationship of power, right? Because the state gets to designate who are terrorists or who are not. My research has shown that there are lots of categories of people who were called terrorists at one stage and now are accepted as nation founders, as resistance fighters from one perspective or another. And so it kind of shuts down a conversation, I suppose, rather than opening it up a little bit yet.

Intervenant 1
But it's intrinsically linked with the politics, emotions and prejudices of our society for a lot of those on the ground. The purpose of counter-terrorism work is much more straightforward. To first and foremost protect their own country and to stop violence at any cost. Here is to join a former MIT counter-terrorism officer who helped foil al-Qaida's 2006 liquid bomb plot, which we call Episode three.

Intervenant 5
As the old saying goes, they've only got to get lucky once. They've got to get lucky all the time.
