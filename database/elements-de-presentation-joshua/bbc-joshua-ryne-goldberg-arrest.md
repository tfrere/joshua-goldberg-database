Intervenant 1

Is BBC trending I'm Michael David charmed and with me the scribe whose words reach the world on our blog BBC dot com plus trending because he edits and writes it. His name is.

Intervenant 2

Hello I'm Mike Wendling.

Intervenant 1

Mike, I believe you're here to tell me about an email you got.

Intervenant 2

Yeah, well, as you can imagine, I get quite a few, but three weeks ago I got one that really stood out. So I was idly scrolling through my messages when I saw one that started like this. I would like you to know that on September the 11th, a pressure cooker bomb is going to be detonated in a large Midwestern U.S. city.

Intervenant 2

Now, my hunch was it was a fake. And of course, there was no bomb attack last week. But the message now appears to be something more than a hoax.

Intervenant 1

According to the federal complaint, 20 year old Joshua Goldberg had a series of Internet conversations with a man he thought would put a pressure cooker bomb in a backpack at a Kansas City 911 inspired event. Okay. We'll be finding out more about that remarkable story later on BBC Trending. I'll also be asking why exactly the world and some pretty big names in America and the president rally behind 114 year old boy from Texas whose school got him arrested as a terrorist.

Intervenant 1

His name, as you probably know, was Ahmed.

Intervenant 1

All right. So let's start with what is undoubtedly the social media trend of the week. And the whole episode is packed into a single day. So you've heard of Ahmed Ahmed Mohammed. He's a 14 year old who lives in Texas. He was arrested for bringing a homemade clock into his school because a teacher got spooked and thought that it was a hoax bomb.

Intervenant 1

And the fact that he's Muslim led to cries of Islamophobia, racism on the Internet by the hashtag I stand with. Ahmed has been used more than one and a half million times on Twitter. It got so big that President Obama, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and others joined in. Olivia less evidence from trending in Washington, D.C.. You did some sleuth work, didn't you?

Intervenant 1

And you found out who actually started this whole campaign.

Intervenant 3

Yeah, I dug in a bit and caught up with the woman who started it all. Her name was Amina Jafari, and she's a 23 year old psychology student at the University of Texas.

Intervenant 1

And I'm guessing from the name that she's also Muslim. It was that was what upset her about it.

Intervenant 3

I think it struck a chord for her as a muslim who'd also faced some discrimination herself.

Intervenant 1

Okay. So here's what she said to you.

Intervenant 3

The fact that his name, his race, his religion had a huge part of it. It really shocked me. My heart was racing. Then I started the hashtag, I said, And then I was like, you know, it's just something that my friends, they really can do something here locally. Tesco increase it, getting bigger and bigger.

Intervenant 1

So that's what she did. She started this hashtag, it got really global. But one interesting question is why were so many Americans upset? What was it about the story of what happened to Ahmed that really riled them up?

Intervenant 3

Well, I think the reason that so many Americans related to the story are it struck a chord because of the wider racial debate that is kind of dominating U.S. headlines at the moment.

Intervenant 1

Like Black Lives Matter.

Intervenant 3

But for this, this is just another example of according to many people, Americans discriminating against people of color. So the image of this teenager who had created something and was clearly very clever, approached into school and was handcuffed, obviously was very shocking to a lot of people.

Intervenant 1

Right. Let me just pick up that is inventing and creating something. I mean, President Obama's message on it. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Google, I think, you know, lots of tech people running through all of this support for him was the idea that, hang on, this is America where making it inventing should be encouraged.

Intervenant 3

Exactly. I think it really tapped into that whole idea of anything can happen once you come to America. People talked about the idea of the American dream as being a representation of sort of discrimination and prejudice, really stifling that idea that anyone from any background, as long as you work hard, can achieve great things in the US.

Intervenant 1

So, Mike, sticking with the U.S., what are the things we're always really aware of here? Obviously, trending is that the people that we come across on the Internet aren't always who they claim to be. People use fake names, especially when they want to say something abusive, maybe racist or sexist. But what gets me about the story that you've been looking into this week is that it shows quite a dangerous second level to that kind of behavior.

Intervenant 2

Yeah, that's right. And this story is about someone who seems not only to have assumed alter egos to bully others, but who also incited other people on the Internet to rally to his cause, or maybe I should say, causes, because he whipped up all sorts of groups from Islamic extremists to neo-Nazis to radical feminists. He even, it seems, encouraged people to commit violence.

Intervenant 2

Real world violence.

Intervenant 1

So what kind of things exactly was he doing?

Intervenant 2

Well, to find out, I first spoke to one of his victims. Ben Garrison is an artist who lives in Montana around the time of the banking crisis. This is 2008. He started drawing political cartoons, lamenting what he saw as the rise of big government. He's a libertarian. He's very proud of it. But soon he found his work was attracting extremists, racist trolls, white supremacists, people he was absolutely appalled by.

Intervenant 2

Now he tried to stop people from making racist comments about his cartoons, but that totally backfired and only enraged the mob. And they started a smear campaign. One day, a friend told him to look at a Facebook page that had been set up in his name.

Intervenant 1

Wait. Set up in his own name?

Intervenant 2

Yes, his own name.

Intervenant 4

I looked at this page and my jaw dropped. I was like, What the hell is going on? Here's a page on Facebook using my photographs and all my cartoons. But they were all vandalized, going to hate and antisemitism and it had thousands of likes on it.

Intervenant 2

And on another website there was much, much worse stuff. Also appearing as Fan had posted it.

Intervenant 4

When I went on there. And so what they were doing, I was that board. I was like, Gee, what is this? I mean, I got like hundreds of these little and they're just like saying all kinds of rotten things. You know, They're saying that when I was younger, I was in Vietnam and I enjoyed cutting off heads and ears and I was in prison and I killed black people in prison.

Intervenant 4

And they're inventing all these weird stories about me and this creature that they created. They turned me into a meme called Zyklon Ben. They actually found a picture of my son and put him in a white supremacist outfit. You know, they put a big emblem on his T-shirt, and my wife, too. They started calling her Treblinka. Tina, you know, make her into a white supremacist wife.

Intervenant 1

Pretty nasty stuff. Who was doing this?

Intervenant 2

Well, Ben Garrison did some digging. He even hired investigators, and he found one of the key puppet masters of all this abuse was a fake identity, a fake account.

Intervenant 1

Okay. I want to hear more about that. But first of all, just what kind of impact did all of this have on Ben Garrison and his life?

Intervenant 2

Well, it was terrible. It more or less destroyed his entire career.

Intervenant 4

If you type in Ben Jerry's and my guess right now is the first thing you'll see is me in a Nazi uniform. And that's rather off putting was I'm trying to get work. I mean, I'm a commercial artist. I depend on getting new clients and so forth. And I haven't had any work in almost three months now. And it's been on the decline for the past few years because nobody wants to hire somebody who was in a Nazi uniform.

Intervenant 1

Okay. So let's do like a recap here. This poor guy's livelihood was taken away by anonymous people on the Internet attacking him. And that happens a lot online. But there was this dangerous extra element here because the trolls were whipped into a frenzy by someone else who was just using a fake identity to do that. And who was this someone else?

Intervenant 1

Do we even know.

Intervenant 2

What we do now? Know who he was and the reason we know is because he was doing exactly the same thing to other people, but not posing as a far right extremist racist, but other things.

Intervenant 3

My name's Elise Potok. I'm an Australian journalist working with CBS TV.

Intervenant 2

One day, Elise Whittaker was chatting to one of her sources, a young Islamic preacher. They both noticed something funny about their social media accounts, and they quickly figured out that someone had been impersonating them both. They follow the trail, which led to a Twitter account at Mooney Metropolis.

Intervenant 3

I confronted him actually on Twitter and I said, Hey, Dan. Good to see you here. And we're not giving him any information. He basically said to me, he confessed to impersonating me on Facebook and he confessed to impersonating the Islamic preacher on Twitter.

Intervenant 2

She turned to another Australian journalist, Luke McMahon, who had ample experience with hidden identities, online attacks and let's say the darker corners of the Internet. Together, they started investigating.

Intervenant 1

It was immediately apparent to me that I was dealing with a classic Internet trolls, but one that was obviously quite sophisticated. You know, when I first started engaging with him, I thought I was dealing with a member of the far right. But as the conversation progressed and I worked out actually what he was doing, it wasn't any kind of ideological crusade, but it was something much different.

Intervenant 2

What Luke and at least were starting to get at was a real person, not an Islamic extremist, not a neo-Nazi racist, not an Australian, but rather a 20 year old living in Florida named Joshua Goldberg.

Intervenant 1

So this guy, Joshua Goldberg, he is the guy your story is really about how many different extremists was he posing as well?

Intervenant 2

Several. He was posing as extremists and all sorts of people. He poses a white supremacist harasser, Ben Garrison. There was the fake Islamic State supporter who sent me that bomb threat that we heard at the top of the program. He went by the name Australia Witness. Joshua Goldberg played conservative activist, neo-Nazis. All sorts of people. He had dozens, maybe hundreds of online identities, and he'd use these identities to harass people.

Intervenant 2

Sometimes he'd even have the fake identities argue amongst themselves.

Intervenant 1

And where is he now?

Intervenant 2

Currently, he's in police custody. He's undergoing a psychological evaluation to see if he's fit to stand trial. His story became known to police and the public because of what he was about to do next.

Intervenant 1

All right. We're just going to pause there for exactly one minute, because there are a lot of other things trending on the Internet. We're going to bring you some of the stories that other people have been sharing this week on the Chinese Internet. People are often calling each other out for not being patriotic enough. This week, millions responded by mixing patriotism with ordinary stuff.

Intervenant 1

Long live the motherland. Who knows which company sells, purchased their white Schultz.

Intervenant 3

A British man who traveled to Syria to fight for the so-called Islamic State has written what seems to be a rant against Arabs and Syrians on Tumblr. He calls them.

Intervenant 1

Childish.

Intervenant 3

And even accuses them of stealing his shoes.

Intervenant 1

Indians share the perils of family life on Twitter using the hashtag Indians family problems. You can't talk to strangers. You can marry the marry the marry. Open the ice cream talk and it's frozen.

Intervenant 3

And the former Australia and Prime Minister Tony Abbott's downfall was celebrated by some on Twitter. The photographs of onions. He famously chomp through a roll onion on a trip to Tasmania the hashtag.

Pushed out during his. And remember you can find us online of BBC dot com slash trending. You can download our podcast. It is free.

Intervenant 1

You're listening to BBC Trending. Now just to recap, we're telling the story of Joshua Goldberg, a 20 year old man with dozens, maybe hundreds of online identities, and his story shows how easy it is to take on new identities online and much worse. He whipped up people using these identities to troll, to attack people. And there's an even more dangerous level to the kind of behavior he was engaging in, isn't it?

Intervenant 2

Yeah, that's right. Because in May of this year, this happened in the US state of Texas.

Intervenant 4

And anti-Islamic cartoon exhibition of the Prophet Muhammad has been attacked by two gunmen. Garland police now say the two men intended.

Intervenant 2

To kill.

Intervenant 4

Intervenant 2

Two Islamic extremists hyped up by the stuff they read online attacked a Draw Mohammed contest in Texas. Now, this was a very controversial event thrown by conservatives and free speech advocates. The attack was thwarted when the two men were shot dead by police.

Intervenant 1

So remember this? This was a big news story and these two alleged extremists were actually killed as they went about this attack. Yes, but what did Joshua Goldberg, sitting alone on the Internet in Florida, have to do with any of that?

Intervenant 2

Well, before the conference, using his alias of a radical Islamist that Australia witness identity, one of the ones we talked about before he posted the address and a map of the contest venue. And he urged people to carry out violent attacks against the contest.

Intervenant 1

So he's gone from online abuse and encouraging others to abuse, to now posing as an Islamic extremist and trying to incite real world acts of violence and real violence is what actually happened.

Intervenant 2

Exactly. Now, other people online were posting the same things, but we know that at least one of the attackers saw Goldberg's messages because they retweeted Australia witness shortly before the attacks.

Intervenant 1

So from the legal facts of this, we know that the attackers knew about Joshua Goldberg's aides. They saw those tweets, but we're not clear whether they were the ones that inspired those alleged extremists to do what they did.

Intervenant 2

Right. And we should underline something here. Joshua Goldberg isn't accused of taking part in an attack, but two very important things happened because of it. First, he started to claim credit for causing the attack.

Intervenant 1

He boasted about it right now.

Intervenant 2

Earlier, I told you about an email I got three weeks ago from Australia. Witness. Here's how it starts.

Intervenant 1

You might know me for inspiring the attack in Garland, Texas, earlier this year.

Intervenant 2

And because he was claiming credit to me and to others online, he was also getting attention from the FBI. And this is the second important thing that happened after those attacks. American investigators got an informant to pose as an Islamic extreme ist and to start chatting with him. Soon, the FBI says Joshua Goldberg was giving this informant detailed instructions on how to carry out a terror attack.

Intervenant 1

So I guess those unwitting conversations with an FBI informant, those are the things that would lead to Goldberg's eventual arrest.

Intervenant 2

Right. An FBI affidavit says that when he was arrested, Goldberg admitted he was behind the online Identity Australia witness. But he says that he meant to lead a militant to kill himself while making a bomb. Or if that failed, he says, Goldberg would have called the cops at the last minute. The idea is here that he'd be hailed as a hero.

Intervenant 1

So that is the story of Joshua Goldberg. We don't know yet whether he'll be charged with a crime, but it's certainly a story of how one man can get into pretty dangerous territory by assuming fake or extremist identities. But I must say, Mike, I've still got one really big and burning question about Joshua Goldberg, which is why would someone do all of this?

Intervenant 2

Well, we should point out one thing here. Joshua Goldberg is going through a mental evaluation to see if he's fit for trial. And reports say that he suffered from depression in the past. So it could just be that he's suffering from mental illness. But there's another question here. Did he have a purpose? A cause?

Intervenant 1

Like an ideology.

Intervenant 2

Right now, the people who know him best, the two Australian journalists who were talking to him online for months, they think that if he did have an ideology, it was one of radical, absolute, completely unfettered, free speech.

Intervenant 1

Okay. I mean, I have to say, if that were true, it would be a pretty extreme interpretation of Australia. Extremely. But can we really be sure about that being his motive?

Intervenant 2

Absolutely not. We can't be sure of anything. I mean, the hall of mirrors here stretches out so far that I'm not even sure the stuff he wrote online under his own name, his real name, Joshua Goldberg, is really what he believes. The mental evaluation that will determine whether Joshua Goldberg is fit to stand trial will take about 4 to 6 weeks.

Intervenant 2

And over the past week, another Social networks have been full of chatter about all of Goldberg's identities, and people are still trying to figure out what they all were and what it all means.

Intervenant 1
