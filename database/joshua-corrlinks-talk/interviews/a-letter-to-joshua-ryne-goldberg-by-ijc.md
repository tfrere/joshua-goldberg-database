Dear Joshua Ryne Goldberg,

My name is Ismaël Joffroy Chandoutis, and I am a French artist and indy filmmaker deeply interested in topics such as counterfactuals, opinion manipulation, polarization, and various forms of online harassment, including doxxing, swatting, deepfakes, and impersonation.

In 2018, I created a film on swatting that employed creative editing techniques to challenge the audience's perceptions. The film features both victims' testimonials and swatters' performances. During the creative process, I found the perspectives of the swatters most intriguing. However, my research indicates that these individuals rarely express their deepest thoughts and life objectives openly online. While investigating, I explored harassment campaigns on platforms like 4chan and Kiwi Farms, particularly noting how these phenomena became more structured around 2014-2015 with the Gamergate affair.

It was during this research that I discovered your unique story. However, I later realized that Moon Metropolis is a fictional pro-Gamergate. From what I've read about you, I believe that media sensationalism often overshadows a nuanced understanding of what your life and actions signify. You've spent nearly a decade navigating the internet, exploring and mimicking various ideological spheres, thereby offering a unique and invaluable perspective.

I've reviewed many of your statements and feel your urge to set the record straight. However, the narratives about you—especially those by Elise Potaka, Luke McMahon, and Ginger Gorman—seem one-dimensional. They appear more interested in furthering their journalistic careers than in revealing the truth. Your first Medium statement provided excerpts from your essay 'Persona Factory.' This offers a more intimate and insightful look into your identity—or more precisely, your struggle with identity. Closer to a diary than a journalistic article or a right of reply, this essay seems a more appropriate medium for understanding your stream of consciousness and existential dilemmas. May I request access to read this essay in its entirety? I also have a series of additional questions about you; please let me know if you are willing to answer them.

Depending on how our discussions evolve, this exploration could manifest as a film. Unlike the formulaic approaches often seen, particularly in the US, I aim to create something undefined—a piece that balances between your internal reality and my artistic vision. The genre could fall somewhere between documentary, fiction, and animation. Of course, we could conceal your identity with an avatar or an animated, unstable silhouette that reflects your internal conflict.

I am not interested in judging or rehabilitating you but wish to create a space where your story can be explored in a nuanced manner.

Should you be interested, I am happy to provide links to my previous films. They have been selected in numerous art exhibitions & festivals including Festival de Cannes, Annecy, AFI, Slamdance, etc.

Given your eclectic list of films and video games on IMDB, which showcases a deep appreciation for high-caliber artistic cinema and video games, I am confident you'd find my works intriguing.

Please feel free to get in touch with me at ismael.joffroy-chandoutis@edugobelins.fr to discuss this proposal further.

Sincerely,

Ismaël Joffroy Chandoutis
