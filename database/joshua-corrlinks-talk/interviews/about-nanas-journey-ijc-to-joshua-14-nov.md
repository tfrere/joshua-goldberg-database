Dear Joshua,

Sorry to get back to you a little later than I wanted, but I had a lot of work to do.

Your synopsis really resonated with me. The universe you describe is deeply shocking, but I also feel a strong artistic vision behind it.

I'd like to understand what prompted you to explore these dark themes. Where did this disturbing idea come from? Your time in SHU seems to have been a powerful trigger. Can you describe the prison environment, the location, the atmosphere, the sequence of the day? What did that prolonged confinement provoke in you emotionally?

Your choice of animation also intrigues me. Beyond circumventing censorship, this medium has a unique artistic dimension. Like Takahata's Tomb of the Fireflies, animation brings memories and unique visual poetry to life. What draws you to animation creatively? What's the point of that? Think about how animation is used in Waltz with Bashir, from Ari Folman for example.

I'd also like to understand how you relate to real-life violent images. Were you exposed to this type of extreme content at an early age? How do you view those who consume snuff or hurtcore? How do you feel about these images?

I had an early relationship with death: a guy was stabbed six feet from me in a bar when I was six years old. I'm less sensitive than most people to the violence that I see, whether it's real or fictional. I feel like it's from that event, but I'm not sure. Our emotions are sometimes mysterious to ourselves.

Your vision of humanity seems so dark and hopeless... Do you think there could be nuances in evil? Have past violence influenced this darkness?

My goal is not to judge you, but to better understand where your inspiration comes from. I hope that this dialogue will enlighten one another.

I'm going to answer you little by little the other threads we've opened. Don't hesitate to answer this one already.

Can't wait to hear your thoughts on all this.
