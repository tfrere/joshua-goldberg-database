Dear Joshua,

The list is great, I just need the context: on which site(s) were the personas used? Context is very important for quick retrieval. Even the creation, ban, or closure dates could be useful to me.

Furthermore, did you intend to impersonate Zoë Quinn? In one of her interviews from November 2015, she mentioned receiving a call from the FBI saying they had arrested someone in Florida who had a 2GB file of documents on her.

Also, do you have a backup of your IRC chats? Including all the people you were in contact with, with Andrew Anglin, Weev, but most importantly the conversation  with Luke McMahon. Anything he might have written to you. For now, with what your lawyer photocopied for the trial, I have discussions starting from May 26, 2015, but I'm sure you had them earlier. For Elise Potaka, there are discussions from April 15, 2015, but in one of the Twitter DMs, she says "hello again" or something like that, suggesting you had already talked. I'd like to know what she said the first time she wrote to you.
There's also something I never understood about Luke McMahon. He had your contact details, he could have easily called your parents since you had more or less told him who you were, and he chose to send an information dossier to the AFP instead.

Is your sister's friend who accidentally talked to Luke Mc Mahon about MoonMetropolis being Joshua @iGotStiles?

Have your parents tried to forbid you to use a computer? Did anyone in your family know what you were doing? If so, why did you tell them?

Finally, for Dean Saxton, can you describe the course of what you did? Why choose him, how did you go about it, when did you do it, and what was the deep reason? If possible, describe as precisely as possible, like a scenario.

For Josh Bornstein, the same question.

Caitlin Ropper, the same question.

Junaid Thorne, the same question.

Ben Garrison, the same question.

What was your very first trolling? I need a date and action, possibly the reason. Was it Ben Garrison?

Your very first creation of a persona? What was the reason?
What gave you the idea to create a persona rather than Joshua Ryne Goldberg yourself on the Internet? Did the first persona creation make you feel in control of your life? To feel powerful? Free? Revenge against the world you hate?
When you create your personas, do you do it instinctively? Or do you research a lot beforehand? Do you always draw inspiration from someone who exists? If so, is the process always to caricature?

It seems to me that you also pretended to be Elise Potaka to talk to Junaid Thorne?

The jihadist chat discussions you sent to Elise, were they real discussions or fake? I believe you also sent them to other journalists and there was even a publication, right?

When the FBI came to your house on September 10, 2015, it was 6 am, right? Did they break down the door and enter like a swatting? Were you awake? Were your parents there? Brothers? Sisters? How did they react? Were they handcuffed? Were you? Were guns pointed at your face? Where is your room in the house? Describe the precise scene, like a scenario.

There were two Reddit accounts that I can't remember the usernames of: a one-off account on /r/SRSsucksORStormfront and a one-off account on /r/fatpeoplestories.  The one on /r/fatpeoplestories had a username that was a random combination of letters, and it posted a ridiculously fake story that included "He who lives by the beetus shall die by the beetus."  There were other random one-off accounts (usually troll accounts) on other websites as well.
