Below is the message that I sent to all of my email contacts (except for my mother) on June 29, 2018, shortly after my sentencing:

If you have been following my case, then you know that I was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  The plea deal was for 8 years, but the judge felt that that wasn't enough.  The prosecutor called multiple witnesses to testify, while my lawyer only called on one at the beginning (my mother).

It was very upsetting for my parents and godparents to see all of the evidence presented against me.  But, as exhausting and devastating as the trial was, I did not shed a single tear.  I guess, over the years, I have learned that suppressing all emotions (other than the most shallow, like anger) is the only emotional strategy that makes sense to me.  I have always had a very hard time understanding and processing feelings.

Even so, I do feel exceptionally hopeless about my situation.  I truly feel that my life is over - cut down before it had even really begun.  In the end, the only people who were truly hurt by my actions were myself and my family.  The stress that I put on my family was overwhelming.  My mother already has multiple sclerosis and a myriad of other problems to deal with, so the last thing that she needed was for her son (and, by extension, her) to be thrust into the middle of a high-profile terrorism trial and an accompanying international media frenzy.  When I was first arrested, I truly feared that my mother would end up in the hospital, if not the morgue.

I also cannot shake the feeling that, in the long run, my family would ultimately be better off if the FBI had shot and killed me when they raided my house.  My family will love me no matter what, but I do not remotely deserve their unconditional love.  From my early childhood right up to the present day, I have done nothing but create constant grief and hardship for them, and, to be perfectly honest, I don't see that ever changing.

In addition, what they saw in court makes it extremely difficult for me to talk to them.  The prosecution, as is their job, went out of their way to paint me as the spawn of Satan, including falsely stating that I had told the undercover FBI informant that it was fine to kill children (I made no such statement and, if I had, you can rest assured that they would have shown it, which they didn't).  I was portrayed as someone who was 100% sincere in their commitment to the sick, oppressive ideology of ISIS, even though everyone who knows me knows that I'm an atheist who regularly criticizes Islam and religion in general.

I blame Australian journalist Luke McMahon constantly egging me on in private for much of what I did.  While I wanted to back out and abandon the "Australi Witness" persona altogether, he knew exactly what manipulative things to say in order to goad me into doing things that would eventually lead to my arrest, which was undoubtedly his ultimate goal from the very beginning.  But, in the end, I mainly have myself to blame for my stupid and reckless actions, which follow a long pattern of stupid and reckless behavior over the course of my short life.

I will now be spending my entire twenties in prison and, when I get out, I will be an unemployable pariah, treated the same as would be Jared Fogle or Jerry Sandusky.  I don't want to forever be a parasitic leech on the family whose name I have forever besmirched, but what other options will I have?  My prison term will eventually expire, but the everlasting black mark of shame that I have placed on myself and my family never will.  And, in the end, that life sentence of shame is infinitely worse than any prison sentence could ever be.
