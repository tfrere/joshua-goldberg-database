When I was in the SHU at Edgefield, my psychologist challenged me to come up with a list of my own personal character traits.  This was what I came up with:

1. I usually project a very dour, saturnine disposition, but will often capriciously oscillate between acting like an angry, toxic, hateful ball of negativity and acting like a puckish, playful child. I also often act like some bizarre, one-of-a-kind combination of both.
2. I tend to be quite vagarious and mercurial in the viewpoints that I espouse, but I generally try my best to always be as iconoclastic and contrarian as possible.
3. I am very obsessive-compulsive in many ways, but certainly not when it comes to cleanliness.
4. I tend to have a very fustian, orotund, grandiloquent manner of speaking, often coming across as pretentious and pedantic.
5. At times, I can be hostile, cantankerous, intransigent, and disputatious. As a child, I had a tendency to be quite recalcitrant and intractable, and my contumacious proclivities got me a diagnosis of oppositional-defiant disorder.
6. I am a misanthrope and a loner in the absolute extreme, and I base my life around avoiding other people as much as I possibly can. I try my best to not have any friends whatsoever.
7. I tend to live my life in the most nihilistic way possible, with a "nothing matters" attitude and a desire to create chaos and watch the world burn. I do not believe in absolute morality.
8. I can behave like the nicest person in the world one minute and behave like a monstrous psychopath the next minute.
9. I can bloviate on endlessly about meaningful subjects and/or subjects I'm interested in, but I have absolutely no interest in mindless piffle, and I usually try to be as taciturn as possible.
10. I have a very negative, cynical, bitter, and misanthropic outlook, with nary a single positive thing to say about anyone or anything.
11. I have an encyclopedic knowledge of certain subjects, which earned me the nickname "Google" as a teenager.
12. I have very bizarre attitudes about sex, avoiding sex like the plague, but having a detached, morbid fascination with sick and deviant sexual practices.
13. I try my best to shut off all emotion, but can never seem to shut off primal anger.
14. I am anhedonic, never really taking pleasure in anything.
15. I am a veritable gallimaufry of contradictions in every conceivable way.
16. As hateful as I am, I am not even remotely a bigot. I hate the human race, but I do not hate any particular race of people.
17. I can be quite funny at times.
18. I like to have a mysterious, enigmatic aura surrounding me.
19. I tend to be very candid, honest, and foursquare, eschewing prevarications and disingenuousness, especially when talking to strangers.
20. The closer I am to someone, the more secretive I am with them and the less I want them knowing about me.
21. My mood tends to remain very low, despondent, and chapfallen.
22. I am not a clean and tidy person, and hygiene ranks low on my list of concerns.
23. I habitually alienate everyone and make myself unwelcome everywhere.
24. I have a much easier time analyzing others than analyzing myself.
25. I am repulsed by intimacy, and try to keep everyone at a distance.
26. I tend to be very snarky and sarcastic, which is the one noticeably un-autistic thing about me.
27. I try my best to always be an enemy of everyone and an ally of no one.
28. I try my best to never trust anyone and to always assume bad faith from everyone.
29. I often will say outrageous things for shock value.
30. I am even more abstruse to myself than I am to other people.
31. I have a tendency to turn myself into fictional characters/personas.
32. I don't attempt to be masculine, but I don't attempt to be feminine either. I tend towards androgyny.
33. I have no social skills, no common sense, and no empathy.
