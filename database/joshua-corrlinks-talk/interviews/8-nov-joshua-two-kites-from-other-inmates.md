Below are two kites (written messages) that I received from other inmates and that I wanted to show you.

This first one was delivered to me on the compound at Terre Haute FCI by a former cellmate who was in the SHU after checking in:

Josh, I owe you some apologies. The first one is for moving out of the cell like I did so suddenly and without talking to you first. This was very childish and inconsiderate of me. The second is for not being a man of my word toward you. I owed you about $50, I believe, when I checked-in. Obviously, I'm not going to be able to pay you now. I also said we would move back in as cellies and then I kept putting off and making excuses. The third thing I must apologize for I never admitted to but I am sure you very well suspected. I am the one that stole the boots I sold to you. I did this just a few weeks after I sold them to you. For everything I have done to you and all the shit I put you through I am sorry. After treating you the way I have and doing the things I've done, the rest of this kite may sound a little like bullshit, but I feel the need to tell you anyways.
I have always considered you a friend, even if you never did me or don't now after knowing I stole from you. But if it's one thing I think I've shared with you in all our talks, it is that I tend to hurt my family and friends the most when I am caught in addiction. I believed very much that God placed us in each other's lives to help each other. You were helping me to let go of the criminal mindset and I was trying to help you come out of your shell. I sincerely regret moving out of the cell with you, especially when you were struggling like you were. I pray for you often and I really wish you the best. I'll never forget you giving that book to me, We Are All Doing Time. That book will forever have changed my life. So thank you. I hope if you have learned anything from our time in the cell together it is that even the worst of us are not all bad, and that there is plenty of the good in the world you just have to look for it. Keep your guard up against deuce [K2] heads like me, Topp, and Goldmouth. Don't let people borrow shit from you, period. I heard what happened with Bump. Terry seems to be a good guy, just misguided sometimes.
God loves you. Stay strong.

Honestly, I wasn't even sure how to feel about this letter (and I'm still not sure how to feel about it).  Like any autistic person, I have a very hard time processing complex emotions like the ones involved with this.  But I was genuinely surprised to see him talk about God like that, because I didn't think that he even believed in God, as he seemed to always have the same anti-religion mentality as me.

When I was at Terre Haute FCI, I typed up someone's book for them (and added a little bit to it, as he requested).  His book - It Takes a Nation to End Gun Violence by Takieon Jack Perkins - is now available for purchase.  During my stint in the SHU this year, he had a psychologist deliver the following kite to me:

Goldberg,

How you doing My friend?!  Hope all is well with you mentally as well as physically.  I miss laughing and joking with you.  I noticed the Ramadan and Passover orders come in at the same time this year.  When I spotted the passover items I thought of you LOL!  Remember, last year you received your order?  You ordered so many cans macaroon's!  I purchased them, mostly, from you.  You took all my money!  LOL!  That was the good ole M-unit days.
Well, my life has taken some turns for the better since you left... I moved down to C-unit, now I live on I-unit as a cadre/mentor.  I am working on book two on the "IT Takes a Nation" series.  My daughter was aceptted at two different Universities out in California where she lives.  She'll finish grade school in a few months. :) My brother finally came home on March 1st from his 18 yr prison sentence.  He has been supportive.  There is more but too much to write; too little time.
As from me to you buddy!  You better be taking your time in that great big Mansion of a cell you have there to exercise, meditate, study, read, write, and plan!  Remember to hold your head up.  Look at things on the bright side... you don't agree w/ living conditions here; You'll be going some place better.  It's 2023!  Your release date will be here before you know it!  I miss you brother.  You take good care of yourself.  Lord willing I'll see you later in life.

As when I received that poignant message from my old cellmate in the SHU, I really don't know how to deal with the complex emotions involved here.  I am, as always, autistic AF.
