Hey... I sent my "Dear Ismael" email before I received this.  Please let me know if you've received it and read it yet.  Because the Corrlinks system is so wonky, it often takes days for emails to be received after they're sent.

Yes, I am open to sharing my story.  I will most likely consent to having text exchanges turned into art, but am more hesitant about super cringey stuff that I wrote years ago.

You will want to save these emails in a file somewhere since they expire after a certain amount of time.

Dear Joshua,

I'm Isma??l Joffroy Chandoutis, a French independent artist and filmmaker. You might recall my recent letter about opening a discussion with you for a potential film project. Mike Wendling from the BBC has kindly facilitated our CorrLink communication, and I appreciate your willingness to engage.

Before we begin, I want to ensure our discussion framework is comfortable for both of us. Are you still open to sharing your story? I plan to ask you a series of questions to help us construct a chronological narrative.

Additionally, would you consent to any text exchanges or materials that we exchange being potentially used and/or transformed in an artistic context, such as a film or an exhibition?

Looking forward to your response,

Best regards,

Isma??l Joffroy Chandoutis
