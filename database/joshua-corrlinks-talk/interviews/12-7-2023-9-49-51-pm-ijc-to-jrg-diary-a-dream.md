Dear Joshua,

Following our conversation : I would need you to write me a detailed diary retracing scenes from your real life from ages 0 to 10, until your mother put you out of school and you start your online classes (don’t forget to explain the what and why).

The idea would be for you to put yourself in your own shoes at those ages, and describe your daily life, dreams, your relationships with your family, your friends, shrinks, your classmates or teachers. Whatever. Stream of consciousness. Let it be!

Try to do it in the present tense, in a very naturalistic way, show don’t tell style, going into details and without passing judgment. Like a novel or a script.

This diary would help me for this film project about your life. Your text would greatly help me develop scenes and a story that could then be turned into an cinematic work. Then I can talk with my producers.

Eliott Roger Manifesto was not that bad in this sense as his manifesto is a diary. Except of course the ending and his theory about women. But this is chronologic and we can understand his internal conflict throughout the time.

Freud said that modern man is civilized when he masters his impulses. To master one's impulses, one must get to work to practice sublimation. Art is an interesting path for this purpose. Certainly more interesting than mass shooting.

I look forward to reading your text.

Best,

Ismaël Joffroy Chandoutis

Here is an extract of
My Twisted World
The Story of Elliot Rodger
By Elliot Rodger

Introduction
Humanity… All of my suffering on this world has been at the hands of humanity, particularly women.
It has made me realize just how brutal and twisted humanity is as a species. All I ever wanted was to fit
in and live a happy life amongst humanity, but I was cast out and rejected, forced to endure an existence
of loneliness and insignificance, all because the females of the human species were incapable of seeing
the value in me.
This is the story of how I, Elliot Rodger, came to be. This is the story of my entire life. It is a dark story
of sadness, anger, and hatred. It is a story of a war against cruel injustice. In this magnificent story, I will
disclose every single detail about my life, every single significant experience that I have pulled from my
superior memory, as well as how those experiences have shaped my views of the world. This tragedy did
not have to happen. I didn’t want things to turn out this way, but humanity forced my hand, and this
story will explain why. My life didn’t start out dark and twisted. I started out as a happy and blissful
child, living my life to the fullest in a world I thought was good and pure…
Part One
A Blissful Beginning
Age 0-5
On the morning of July 24th, 1991, in a London hospital, I was born. I breathed in the first breath of
life as I entered this world, weighing only 5.4 pounds. My parents must have been filled with happiness
and pride that day. They had just witnessed the birth of their first child, and they named me Elliot Oliver
Robertson Rodger.
I was born to young parents. My father, Peter Rodger, was only 26 when he impregnated my mother,
Chin, who was 30. Peter is of British descent, hailing from the prestigious Rodger family; a family that
was once part of the wealthy upper classes before they lost all of their fortune during the Great
Depression. My father’s father, George Rodger, was a renowned photojournalist who had taken very
famous photographs during the Second World War, though he failed to reacquire the family’s lost
fortune. My mother is of Chinese descent. She was born in Malaysia, and moved to England at a young
age to work as a nurse on several film sets, where she became friends with very important individuals in
the film industry, including George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. She even dated George Lucas for a short
time.
My mother and father had been married for a couple of years before my mother became pregnant
with me. In fact, her pregnancy was an accident. She had been taking pills to prevent pregnancy, but
when she visited my father on one of his film sets, she fell ill and the medication she took for that illness
thwarted the effect of the anti-pregnancy pills, and so their lovemaking during this period resulted in my
life.
Only a couple of months after my birth, I went on my first vacation. My parents took me on a boat to
France. I was already a traveler! Of course, I have no memories of this trip. My mother said that I cried a
lot.
At the time that I was born, my mother and father were living in a house in London, but shortly after
my birth they decided to move to the countryside. We moved to a large house made of red brick in the
county of Sussex, with vast grass fields surrounding it. The house even had a name: The Old Rectory.
This was where I spent my early childhood, the first five years of my life, and it was beautiful. The
memories I have of this period are only memories of happiness and bliss.
My father was a professional photographer at the time, just in the stage of becoming a director. My
mother gave up her nursing career to stay at home and look after me. My grandma on my mother’s side,
who I would call Ah Mah, moved in with us to help out my mother. I would spend a lot of time with Ah
Mah during these years.
This was a time of discovery, excitement, and fun. I had just entered this new world, and I knew
nothing of the pain it would bring me later on. I enjoyed life with innocent bliss. I can remember playing
in the fields and going on long walks with Ah Mah to pick berries. She would always warn me not to
touch the stinging nettles that sometimes grew in our fields, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I
got stung a few times. There was a swing in the back of our yard, which I had many good times on.
The first birthday I remember was my 3rd birthday. My parents threw a party for me in our field. I had
a helicopter birthday cake. I can remember one of my friend’s parents cutting off the first piece and
giving it to my friend. I threw a tantrum because I was expecting to get the first piece… It was my
birthday after all. My father bought me a toy tractor that I could ride around in, and I would play with it
all the time after that.
Sometime after my 3rd birthday, we all went on a vacation to Malaysia, my mother’s home country. I
have only flashes of memory of that vacation. I enjoyed it very much. We visited a few of my mother’s
relatives.
For preschool, I was enrolled at Dorsett House, an upscale all-boys private school in the countryside,
near where we lived. I was forced to wear a uniform, which I hated because I had to wear
uncomfortable socks up to my knees. I was very nervous and I cried on my first day there. I can
remember two friends I made by name, George and David. I would always play in the sandpit with them.
I didn’t like school at Dorsett House very much. I found the rules to be too strict. My least favorite
part of it was the football sessions. I never understood the game and I could never keep up with the
other boys in the field, so I always stood by the goal-keeper and pretended to be the “second goalkeeper”.
My favorite part was playing in the woods after lunch. There was a particular climbing structure
that I had a lot of fun with.
My preschool class once went on a field trip to the park, where I had the misfortune of getting lost.
As my class was eating lunch, I ventured off to another area of the park, and when I returned, my class
had moved on. I remember panicking and asking strangers for help. It was a terrifying experience for
me. I was eventually led to my class by the strangers I talked to.
I remember one funny incident when we were taking school pictures. They forced us to sit crosslegged,
which I hated doing, so I absolutely refused to sit that way for the picture. The teachers
eventually conceded, and the picture was taken with me being the only one sitting differently.
The holiday season was the best part of the year for me. It must have been very cold in England, but I
don’t remember the cold. I just remember how much fun I had. I was filled with joy when it started
snowing outside – I loved playing in the snow. My father helped me build a snowman once. We would
start with little snowballs, and roll them around our field until we formed the body, and then we would
decorate it.
During Christmas, my parents always had parties and gatherings. My father’s best friend, Christopher
Bess, who was also my godfather, came to our house frequently. We would often go to my father’s
parent’s house in Smarden, Kent. I would call my grandmother on my father’s side “grandma Jinx”.
