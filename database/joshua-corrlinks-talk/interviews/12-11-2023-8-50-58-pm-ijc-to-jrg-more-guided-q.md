Joshua,
to help you remember, I think we can go back to the discussions you had with your lawyer, which he used to draw up the memorandum. To help you remember, I suggest that, for each question, you close your eyes, imagine where you are at that moment, remember whether it's day or night, the weather, where you are, how you're dressed, the time, then the people, your interaction with them, or the action you're doing. How you react to things. What your motivations are at that moment. These are memory arts techniques, to help you remember.

In the memorandum, it says:

"They are both special education teachers. They are familiar with autism as they teach autistic kids as
part of their jobs."
How come they didn't detect that you might be autistic, even though they're used to dealing with autistic children, according to you?

"Joshua's first mental health evaluation took place when he was seven years 7
old." Why were you taken for a health evaluation? Was there a particular event, a particular reason?

Tell me about Hope Haven Children's Clinic. Have you been in contact with psychologists since the age of 7? What questions did they ask, what games did they play, what tests did they run? I need to understand your relationship with shrinks. Since on the WongPlanet forum, you write a letter that you don't send:
Posted: 10 Aug 2011, 5:08 am
Dear Therapists, Psychologists, and Other Assorted Quacks,
You're so predictable.
Sincerely, Metropolis

"oppositional defiant disorder ("ODD") and mood disorder."
how did it manifest itself? Describe specific scenes.

There's a girl being interviewed in 2015 in Orange Park who says she knows you. That she went to elementary school with you. She said you played cowboys and Indians like any other child. But then she went to middle school and the two of you lost touch. Sound familiar?

"The Hope Haven records do identify "his bizarre ideation and asocial behavior" that set him apart from his peers who
were rejecting him"
Can you describe any scenes of bizarre ideation and asocial behabior? Why did others reject you? Give me examples of scenes or situations that come to mind.

Dr. Serge Vilvar
Serge Vilvar at Baptist Behavioral Health, was he the one following you all the time? What was your relationship with him like? What questions did he ask? Describe any sessions you remember with him. Describe the place, how it was.

Did Dr. Adeirdre Stribling Riley help you? What did he ask you? Tell me what you remember about your sessions with him.
TEACCH program : did it help you ? When you were told you were diagnosed with autism, was there any sense of relief at finally knowing what you had? I note that you were on Wrong Planet, as I said before. Did you have any doubts? Had you told your parents that you thought you were autistic? When you finally got the right medication, did you feel better in your life? mentally? Physically?

"As indicated, his mental diseases manifested themselves as soon as he was placed in
preschool with other children. According to the report from TEACCH, he was never able
to have any true friends. He had one kid in the neighborhood with whom he played video
games. That was the closest Joshua ever came to having a real friend. That relationship
ended at age ten."
Tell me about your relationship with this friend. How did you meet? What video games did you play together? Was it at home? Was it at his place? Did you see each other often? What ended your relationship at age 10?
When did you first play a video game?

His parents placed Joshua into the Boy Scouts, but Joshua was teased and
ostracized due to his illnesses.
describe what happened at the boy scouts. Scenes, words, write like a screenplay, so I can see and hear your stories.

"The same things happened in school in his early years. He
was bullied and teased constantly. As of fifth grade, Joshua was no longer capable of
coping in a traditional school environment."
What happened before you were harassed? I really need to have a description of the scenes, the actions, your interactions with others to understand your problem at the time. What made it impossible for you to cope? Was it you who asked to leave the school? The teachers who alerted you to the situation? Your mother? Did your father agree with your mother?

"He started attending a virtual school over the
internet in fifth grade."
when you started home schooling, was it a relief for you or an extra punishment?

"He was never able to get back into a traditional school as a regular student.
What made it impossible for you to return? Did you want to go back to school? Or was it your mother or father?

Did you ever go to the garden or the pool? What rooms did you go into? The living room, the kitchen? Your brothers' and sisters' bedrooms? What was your relationship with them?

I understand if there are redundancies with things already written to mike and that it's time-consuming to retype everything. i'll ask mike about the texts you've written.

I'll get back to you tomorrow about the rest of what you've written and I'll try to answer your requests for documents.
