I didn't have any documents on Zoe Quinn, and I certainly didn't have a 2GB file on her.  That must have been someone else.  I never actually said a single word to Zoe Quinn - not even under any troll accounts.  I stoked the fires of Gamergate on both sides under various fake identities, but I had zero contact with Quinn herself.  Other than Mariam Veiszadeh, I didn't really do targeted harassment of individuals.  I mainly just did grand, spectacular stunts designed to enrage as many people at once as I possibly could.  I can think of only 2 times when I ever actually threatened any individuals: the first time, I used a library computer to leave a threat on Wikipedia mod Netsnipe's talk page (he had blocked me from editing as a preteen).  The second time, I had "Australi Witness" threaten Josh Bornstein.

I don't have backups of my IRC chats, but most of my conversations with Luke McMahon were over Twitter DMs.  I think all of my conversations with Elisa Potaka were over Twitter DMs.

No, @iGotStiles is not my sister's friend who Luke McMahon contacted.  @iGotStiles is most likely someone who lived on the street with me and my sister when we were kids.

I only once had a brief conversation with my parents about having fake identities online, but I never mentioned the terrorist ones.  My sister's friend is the only person who I told about the terrorist one before my arrest.

I remembered 2 more: B&W Anime Fan and Anti-Colonel Sanders on Wikipedia (both when I was 11) and the fake neo-Nazi troll Nigger_Killing_Hour on IMDb (just to be perfectly clear: in reality, I absolutely hate neo-Nazis and racist people in general).  Anti-Colonel Sanders is one of the earliest cases of one of my troll accounts; I had the account edit Wikinews articles to say that Colonel Sanders was responsible for the 9/11 attacks, then had my "B&W Anime Fan" account attempt to add Anti-Colonel Sanders to Wikipedia's Vandal Hall of Fame (the Long-Term Abuse page).  I was caught and permanently blocked from editing, of course.

My fake Dean Saxton claimed to be the one responsible for "The Philosophy of Rape", which, as I told you before, was actually one of the mods from /r/strugglefucking who went rogue.

I tried to smear Amnesty International and the Australian Human Rights Law Centre with fake jihadist conversations where the fake jihadists claimed to be working for those organizations.  Some of those fake conversations got picked up by Australian media, but the parts about AI and the HRLC were not published.

I very briefly pretended to be Elise Potaka to ask Junaid Thorne a question that Elise Potaka had asked my fake Junaid Thorne account to verify its validity.

I used Twitter Ads to send out inflammatory messages into thousands of peoples' Twitter feeds under the name of Josh Bornstein and then, later, under the name of Caitlin Roper.  Previously, I had published a fake pro-genocide editorial on The Times of Israel under Bornstein's name.  The Ben Garrison accounts were troll accounts as well, of course.  The Junaid Thorne account was a more convincing fake, until the real Junaid Thorne took notice of it, announced that it was fake, and decided to return to Twitter himself as a result.

The FBI came to my house at around 8 AM, if I recall correctly.  They busted down my door and many guys in SWAT gear came in, pointed guns at me, said "I will shoot you, motherfucker" (exact quote), and took me to the ground and handcuffed me.  They apparently called my parents beforehand to tell them what would happen.  My parents were at work.  I was the only one at home at the time.

As The Verve once put it, "I'm a million different people from one day to the next."  Or, as the much lesser-known Hey Ocean! put it, "it's easier to be somebody else when you hardly even know yourself."  On the internet, I could be anyone I wanted to be, and creating characters seemed to come far more naturally to me than figuring out any real sense of self-identity.

The earliest examples of me trolling were when I was a preteen on sites like Wikipedia, Gaia Online, IMDb, and YTMND.

MetropolisAngel on Adult Swim was probably me, but some of those Australi Witness usernames that you rattled off, I'm pretty sure, were not me and must have been other people imitating my fake jihadist.  @aussecret is still up, to the best of my knowledge; that was my last "Australi Witness" account.

Snow_Angel_Metropolis was on MySpace.

Dear Joshua,

The list is great, I just need the context: on which site(s) were the personas used? Context is very important for quick retrieval. Even the creation, ban, or closure dates could be useful to me.

Furthermore, did you intend to impersonate Zo?? Quinn? In one of her interviews from November 2015, she mentioned receiving a call from the FBI saying they had arrested someone in Florida who had a 2GB file of documents on her.

Also, do you have a backup of your IRC chats? Including all the people you were in contact with, with Andrew Anglin, Weev, but most importantly the conversation  with Luke McMahon. Anything he might have written to you. For now, with what your lawyer photocopied for the trial, I have discussions starting from May 26, 2015, but I'm sure you had them earlier. For Elise Potaka, there are discussions from April 15, 2015, but in one of the Twitter DMs, she says "hello again" or something like that, suggesting you had already talked. I'd like to know what she said the first time she wrote to you.
There's also something I never understood about Luke McMahon. He had your contact details, he could have easily called your parents since you had more or less told him who you were, and he chose to send an information dossier to the AFP instead.

Is your sister's friend who accidentally talked to Luke Mc Mahon about MoonMetropolis being Joshua @iGotStiles?

Have your parents tried to forbid you to use a computer? Did anyone in your family know what you were doing? If so, why did you tell them?

Finally, for Dean Saxton, can you describe the course of what you did? Why choose him, how did you go about it, when did you do it, and what was the deep reason? If possible, describe as precisely as possible, like a scenario.

For Josh Bornstein, the same question.

Caitlin Ropper, the same question.

Junaid Thorne, the same question.

Ben Garrison, the same question.

What was your very first trolling? I need a date and action, possibly the reason. Was it Ben Garrison?

Your very first creation of a persona? What was the reason?
What gave you the idea to create a persona rather than Joshua Ryne Goldberg yourself on the Internet? Did the first persona creation make you feel in control of your life? To feel powerful? Free? Revenge against the world you hate?
When you create your personas, do you do it instinctively? Or do you research a lot beforehand? Do you always draw inspiration from someone who exists? If so, is the process always to caricature?

It seems to me that you also pretended to be Elise Potaka to talk to Junaid Thorne?

The jihadist chat discussions you sent to Elise, were they real discussions or fake? I believe you also sent them to other journalists and there was even a publication, right?

When the FBI came to your house on September 10, 2015, it was 6 am, right? Did they break down the door and enter like a swatting? Were you awake? Were your parents there? Brothers? Sisters? How did they react? Were they handcuffed? Were you? Were guns pointed at your face? Where is your room in the house? Describe the precise scene, like a scenario.

There were two Reddit accounts that I can't remember the usernames of: a one-off account on /r/SRSsucksORStormfront and a one-off account on /r/fatpeoplestories.  The one on /r/fatpeoplestories had a username that was a random combination of letters, and it posted a ridiculously fake story that included "He who lives by the beetus shall die by the beetus."  There were other random one-off accounts (usually troll accounts) on other websites as well.
