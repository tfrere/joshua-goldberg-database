Do you have a script to read for Nadia Harlow Tv show?

You’re right about the power of animation over live action. But beyond the power of animation, there is also always a very intimate decision in the choice of this medium over the real. Same with fiction over documentary. Or the desire to blur the boundaries. So the question is, beyond the violence, what is it that makes animation more acceptable and tolerated for you than fiction that makes you choose this medium? Animation is often for the animators I have met the desire to build their own world, to have control over it where over the real there is always something that escapes us. We have to compose with but that doesn't necessarily match what we would like. And we have to face the other, be it an actor, actress, speak, put words on things, communicate things that take us away from a direct link with the formal or narrative material. That's why The Alphabet, the Lynch short film, has this autobiographical character of the trauma of words. He's a painter before being a filmmaker.

So I agree when you say that what you experienced in Terre Haute, before in your life, at SHU, etc., words are not enough. But since I don't have direct access to your stream of thought or what you hear or see, I only have your words - however incomplete they may be - to imagine what you experienced.

What happened for you to end up in SHU?

Can you describe me from a sensory point of view, what was that room like, the elements, textures, lights, all the details. The sounds too. Your stream of thought at that time. Very precisely.
You can also describe a specific day that comes to mind from beginning to end.
What was your cell like before SHU as well.

What do you think made you an atheist, nihilist, misanthrope? Is there a specific event or did you shape this point of view yourself? Did it come from a series of events?

On humanity, I agree with you on the horrors you cite. We can add the nuclear bomb and the Gaza/Israel poisoning and we are good to say that there is no hope. But apparently, we have to deal with this shitty reality, right?

When was the first time you discovered and browsed the darknet?
What did you see? Did what you saw shock you? Traumatize you? Did it change your worldview?
On the un diplomats, do you have a particular case that you know and that was your source of inspiration? Someone you know personally?

A specific crime story?

Sunrise: I studied it in high school, I love this movie I must have seen it dozens of times!

Wakamatsu is a director that I love but I didn't know go go second time virgin I will watch it within the week.

When you say you identify with the character in Excision,

Can you describe how you had problems by acting like a psycho behavior?

You say you have a strange attitude towards sex, can you elaborate?

I see for the following a very strong coherence in the profiles whether with Ferrara, taxi driver, joker etc and obviously those mentioned before, of vulnerable people outside the norm, somehow victim of the system and who will take revenge because they no longer believe in humanity. It's something where you can identify yourself since it then inspires you to write scripts. I deduce that there is certainly an umbilical link between you and the emotions you feel through the screen and these characters. Often there has been an act of violence like for example rape. In your case, is there an event in your life that triggered this desire to see the world burn? Did you think about taking revenge directly on someone who would have hurt you, like in these movies? If so, what did you consider and finally what stopped you from going through with this plan?

The non-stop grief and misery towards the parents, please elaborate? What is your relationship with them? Did they ignore you? Didn't they help you? Do you love them or do you hate them? If you hate them what could be the reason? Same for your brothers and sisters, describe your relationship. Similarly, did you have a connection with your biological parents and if so what is that connection?

In excision, when you talk about the herpes scene, were you physically violent towards someone as a teenager? Or just through the internet?

What was it like at butner?

Can you describe me in detail the shape of your cell and the objects that made it up? Was it cold or hot? What was the staff you talked to like? The shrinks? What kind of questions did the shrinks who handled you ask? Did they ask you to write about things? If so what? Did you have to do activities? If so what were these activities? What was your morning routine there? If you have transcripts of discussions with any shrink you talked to, verbatim texts, anything can help me. How long did you stay? On what basis did they tell you "now" you are able to face trial? On what evolution on your part? What sentence or awareness or understanding? What thing that you would have understood that was not the case before?

What did it make you feel to see this person die in real life? Did you feel any particular emotion or not at all?

On the hardcore subject, you probably want to talk about Terry Knope II and raylaine knope? I guess they're by your side with other crazies still. It must be hard for you. I hope these are things you didn't experience as a child.

I asked you a lot of questions, feel free to answer some or all in a precise way, these are questions aimed at showing you the level of development I need first to understand and then transform at the artistic level. The more precision I have, the more we will avoid narrative reductionism and smooth stories that pretend the world makes sense.

Generally speaking, I welcome any written interaction between you and other people (shrinks, journalists, friends, family, cellmates), in which there is something at stake, an interest for you, anything that could help me understand your relationship between you and others. Your way, finally, of expressing yourself to the world.

Looking forward to reading from you soon,

Ps: by the way, I met Catherine breillat a few years ago, brilliant director who had caused me to have some people in my class who wouldn't speak to me anymore when I showed them a real young girl and fat girl at the movie club when I was 15 ;-)
