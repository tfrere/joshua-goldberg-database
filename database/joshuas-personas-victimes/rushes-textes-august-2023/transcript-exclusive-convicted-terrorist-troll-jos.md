**i was in public school until fifth grade (10-11 ans)**

**which is when my mom held me out of**

**public school and had me take online**

**school instead i briefly went back to**

**public school in ninth grade**

**but i didn't uh like it so i decided to**

**go back to doing online school for the**

**rest of my schooling**

**well i would say probably the earliest**

**incarnations of**

**that behavior were when i was 11 that**

**was when i really started engaging in**

**in that kind of activity online um but**

**it didn't take on quite the**

**magnitude of what it was at the top of**

**my arrest**

**until later**

**although actually now that i think about**

**it i did have a bunch of i had all sorts**

**of fake accounts when i was when i was a**

**pre-teen but as far as them being like**

**fully fleshed out uh i'd say that was**

**later probably when i was in my team**

**i had almost 40 different reddit**

**accounts that i remember at the top of**

**my arrest and**

**obviously that's just one website i was**

**active on uh**

**on countless websites but i say as far**

**as that that that sort of activity is**

**probably the most active uh on reddit**

**along with i had i had a few different**

**uh personas on twitter as well and some**

**that that had gotten published uh**

**articles published like on sites like**

**thought catalog**

**and then of course i had the fake**

**neo-nazi persona michael slay which was**

**a writer on the daily storm or the most**

**visited neo-nazi website and i just**

**recently put out an article on medium uh**

**talking in detail about that the article**

**is called i am michael slay the**

**incredibly strange incredibly true story**

**that's how someone the last name**

**goldberg became a writer**

**[Music]**

**to my arrest or after my arrest prior to**

**uh prior to my arrest yeah i'd say it**

**was it was probably that one uh**

**the account that i had on reddit known**

**as european 88 was**

**by far the most uh notorious uh neo-nazi**

**on reddit and one of the most notorious**

**on the entire internet that account was**

**a moderator of**

**just about every single uh white**

**supremacist community on reddit**

**correctly now there's over 250 of them**

**um**

**in hindsight what would have been funny**

**and what i should have done is once i**

**got that account turned into a moderator**

**on all those neo-nazi subreddits i**

**should have replaced all of them with**

**gay interracial porn**

**okay well the one that i got arrested**

**for was known as australian witness**

**which reported to be a**

**lebanese-australian**

**supporter**

**accounts on twitter and it never really**

**took off uh but that one**

**got some attention early on and then it**

**grabbed the attention of some**

**journalists and uh**

**i really wanted to abandon that account**

**altogether to be honest because i knew**

**quite what it could potentially lead to**

**but at this time i was being acted on by**

**uh by an australian journalist who later**

**broke the story about me**

**after my arrest but um**

**that was what what ultimately led to my**

**arrest was was that personally**

**australian witness**

**okay and what exactly uh when you got**

**indicted what were you indicted for and**

**convicted of**

**my initial indictment was for**

**distribution of bomb making materials**

**with intent it was later changed to**

**attempting malicious destruction of a**

**building with an explosive device**

**okay and one of the one big thing you do**

**you try to entice people to blow stuff**

**up is that basically the nutshell what**

**it is**

**that is what they they said yes at my**

**trial they they went out of their way to**

**portray me as someone who was actually**

**sincerely committed to**

**isis ideology even though i i knew they**

**knew that was not the case but**

**uh i i my lawyer hardly said a single**

**word at my trial he didn't really have**

**witnesses that he called the standing**

**briefly and called my mother to the**

**stand at the beginning and asked her a**

**few questions that were largely**

**completely irrelevant and insubstantial**

**and then he didn't really say anything**

**for the rest of the trial it was**

**entirely the prosecution**

**and uh in the presentation that my**

**lawyer presented to the judge uh**

**you know the written presentation is**

**i saw that his argument**

**rather than trying to focus on how i was**

**trying to infiltrate online chicago**

**spheres in the hopes of becoming**

**potentially a journalist or an fbi agent**

**my lawyer for whatever reason's approach**

**was**

**to emphasize the judge that was trying**

**to create chaos even quoting a 4chan**

**post that i had made where i said**

**something like i created an isis account**

**on twitter how can i use it to create as**

**much chaos as possible it's very hard**

**for me to imagine how exactly he thought**

**that that would help my defense but**

**needless to say it didn't the plea deal**

**was for eight years the prosecutor asked**

**for eight years the judge felt that that**

**was not enough**

**oh the judge gave you like an important**

**punch well**

**i gave you more time**

**than even the prosecutor was asking how**

**long was your child**

**how long was it how many days**

**hours**

well the second thing was like

not long at all that took place all

well

close to three years but i i started my

first confidence evaluation and uh

in late 2015 after my arrest and then i

was sentenced in 2018

my first confidence evaluation was in my

this call was from a federal

my first competency evaluation was at

miami fdc where they said that i was not

competent then later i had a confidence

evaluation at butner fmc

uh which they kept extending and

extending over and over again but

eventually said that i was confident

and uh what were you what were they what

were you diagnosed as

did they give you

is there any um

mental health evaluations that you had

after

you've been to prison or were you

diagnosed

oh somebody oh it's not the phone's

beeping okay no it's okay

what were you diagnosed with uh in the

vlp what did they say you have

okay well at miami they gave a

completely erroneous diagnosis of

schizophrenia spectrum disorder uh it

was later

uh

it was later decided at butler that that

was not the case and i agree that's not

the case was not that schizophrenia but

at butler i was evaluated by uh experts

in the fields of autism and that was the

main diagnosis that they gave me was

that

okay that's the first time you found

that out that's the first time you aware

that and the first time a psychologist

has ever diagnosed you with that it was

the first time i had been officially

diagnosed with it i knew that i had that

for a while on the street and the

psychologist that i saw on the street i

repeatedly brought it up to her and

every time she would just blow me off

and tell me i didn't have it i had a

completely worthless psychologist on the

street but on the street i did know that

i had autism for a while at least since

i was

probably about maybe 15 or 16 or so but

i did not get any actual diagnosis of

autism until after my arrest

okay let me ask you this um

what was what what

tell me about a a day in the life of

joshua goldberg on the street

at what point in my life

uh how old were you when you got

arrested

i was 20 when i got arrested okay so 19

year old 19 year old joshua gopher tell

me about it for your day

well um

i mean

at that point i

was living a very reclusive life i was

in

college and i was i was enrolled in

college classes i was not i had not

moved to a college campus yet but i do

recall there was one class that i did

take in person at the college when i

went to that class i did not actually

talk to anyone and i would wait until

everyone was gone before i talked to the

teacher

but i was enrolled in college

classes but i took as many classes

online as i could i

lived a very uh you know reclusive and

uh solitary life i based my life around

avoiding other people as much as

possible a lot of people have called me

a loser because of that but the thing

they failed to take into account is that

i willingly elected to live that way i

was not someone like you know like

elliot roger or alexian who acted like a

disgusting creep and got

rightfully rejected by everyone i was

not considered a disgusting creep it was

something that i tried to be alone as

much as i possibly could

okay yeah okay so um in prison uh how

are you doing

well on that note what's actually ironic

is that i am

probably the most well-liked person uh

on the unit although again i'm still the

biggest loner on the compound um

nobody has a problem with me almost

everyone thinks very highly of me and

they they regard me as being the most

trustworthy and reliable in me and

someone who's never gonna do that wrong

um

i have been

i have been i have been targeted by

certain staff members um because they

see bs

because they see me as an easy target

because of my autism

but uh that's that's typical behavior

for people that are you know in law

enforcement it's family people that were

bullies in school that seek out careers

in law enforcement

he had been shipped to a different

institution to contact me to goldberg

wright joshua goldberg

63197-018 terre haute federal

correctional institution p.o box 33

terre haute indiana

so uconn uh goldberg is g-o-l-d-b-e-r-g

uh he'll write anybody back that writes

him by the way really smart guy for sure

he'll write back likes likes to

correspond people v email all that

um

but go check out some of his writings

damn where's that last one oh i am

michael slay i was just going through

that right now you guys it's long and if

you got time but check it out look at

the

the i mean

uh he's got like he's got like white

nazis and

uh talks about talks about uh

him being

writing for uh the daily stormer

uh about his article about fundamental

legalizing

rape is good fundamentally for america

he was trolling though you know i was

like that's what it all was okay

so yeah it's a bit long this video i

don't know how this is going to work out

for real so let me do

the second recording of him

and final one

iphone

my personal one of the two most

important

of the conversation what is there

anything you want to happen you want

people to know

yourself

one thing i remember saying in the

initial interview that you had done with

me the one that you actually deleted was

that

uh most people who are familiar

or who have heard about my case at all

uh assume that i fall into either one of

the two most hated camps of extremists

they either think that i'm an islamic

jihadist or that i am alright

and one thing i want to make as clear as

i possibly can is that i am absolutely

not either of those things

okay yeah you're right i did i did do

that and by the way just let people know

i did an interview with them

earlier and i deleted it somehow

anyway go back to the technology thing

um so

where since you've been in prison how

many articles have you written and how

many are published and where they

publish that

well since i've been to prison

i've only put out two articles both of

them on medium i put out that public

statement on medium in 2018

and then i put out the i am michael slay

one this year on media

medium is a website where

uh anyone can can just publish their

articles uh it's not like an uh like you

know a site where one has to get their

articles approved for publication it's

not anything like that it's essentially

the equivalent

as of now

i could potentially get released next

year

uh

what's your plan

for the future

uh that i have not figured out to be

perfectly honest with you i have no idea

what i should

have do given writing a thought

you're one of one of a really really

talented writer

i mean

something recording you know you can you

can probably dive into when you get out

i'm

sure i mean anything is going to be

extremely difficult for me because of

the the baggage that that's carried with

the charge that i was given

there are many publications that are

going to

be willing to give

any kind of voice to someone who's

perceived as being a terrorist even

though

i mean you know i'm not a real terrorist

but

the government has to be labeled as a

terrorist and publications are not going

to be eager to give a voice to someone

like that well i guess i guess that's

one of the reasons i wanted to do this

is because i did meet you i didn't i did

know you for some time um

and i clearly know that you're not a

carers so what people perceive

maybe this can help change your mind and

get to understand the real you um

and i kind of disagree with what you're

how you think and feel about what's

going to happen when you get out i think

it could be the opposite

things are different josh i mean even

since you've been in uh

that might be a selling point that might

be a reason why people want you direct

for their publication especially when

they when they re when they see how well

you like

uh how articulate you are and uh yeah so

i think there's a future that would be

limited my opinion

a future a future in journalism for you

if you wanted it or to do something that

way or even start your own youtube

channel or something i mean it's crazy

it's

it's totally different i mean how many

years you've been in right now

i was arrested september 10th 2015. so

yeah i mean it's just everything i mean

of course it's changed for me and i'm

living a whole different world than the

last since i was in 24 years but even

the six seven years you've been gone

it's just so much different

there's a there's a

reform kind of movement uh at the same

time you've got the the

man out at san francisco that's getting

recalled for being too progressive so

i don't know people people just look at

criminals

uh convicted per people a little

differently than they did from years

back that's the truth

anyway

so yeah you gotta you've got a hell of a

case really interesting case uh sad

because

it's sad because if somebody would have

put some effort

into looking at your case and seeing it

truly for what it was

uh i think the outcome could have been

different

meaning

that they have to be labeled as

terrorists like you said and trying to

get people to blow each other up or

whatever it's it's

they would have looked at the real

election i think the outcome could have

been totally different for you

that's what i believe that's my personal

opinion

anyway so

what's your routine in prison right now

um well it's it's typical because as you

know the prison system is designed to

just absolutely beat you down and to

grade you and dehumanize you as much as

possible and to turn you into nothing

but a whiffering shell of a person so

that you can never function again on the

outside and keep coming back to prison

and keep funding industrial complex that

they do everything they possibly can to

take away not just all of your physical

possessions but also every last shred of

dignity and humanity that you have

this call is from a federal prison

sorry

i hate that [ __ ] they do everything they

possibly can to take away not just all

of your physical possessions but to take

away every last shred of dignity and

humanity that you have and being in

prison has really opened my eyes to

what the police really are the police

are not here to protect and serve they

are here to abuse and oppress

okay

all right

yeah uh so you are what about the covet

schedule is it over in there now or not

they were loosening up as far as the

covet restrictions go but now they're

back to to tighter covered restrictions

and

uh you would think that the uptick in

coping cases would lead to tighter uh

you know

safety measures in the kitchen but no

the kitchen here is still run like some

kind of

comedy movie caricature of a badly

ruined kitchen with cockroaches and

mice and rats everywhere they were

forcing people to work in the kitchen

when they knew they had covered uh it's

it's ridiculous but

there's nothing i can do about it

obviously you're in the same

administration as when i was at

the same administration yeah same warden

no the that that horrible war that we

had lammer uh he went to victorville usp

which is exactly the kind of hell

but we still have the same captain

um

we still have uh the aws are guests and

dixon they're probably the two best

staff members of this entire institution

um

it's still more or less the same

administration uh

but yeah we thankfully happen to have

awarded it now do you still have the

same you don't have to say her name did

you stop the same case manager

it's still miss hall yes okay well

that's good for you

you know

she's a really good person anyway

uh

so yeah okay so that's about it um like

i said i just want to make sure you got

everything you wanted to say out

i will uh i will send you an email this

is what happened so this week i'm doing

interviews and all of a sudden i'm

getting bombarded with different stuff

that idiot that i used to be so mates

with dean

stand up for themselves so staff know

they can get away with tormenting you i

i

at butler ffc they're the most vile

statistic i've ever encountered and the

primary reason for that is because at

butler ffc most of the inmates are

mentally unsound and therefore cannot

stand up for themselves so staff know

they can get away with tormenting and

abusing and antagonizing the inmates

how is the sis still the same there

sherman

other is

are still the same i'm sure they're

listening to this phone call

yeah he's heavily monitored yeah i don't

know

for sure they are yeah yeah but i don't

i don't have any issues with any of the

sis officers here uh

it turns out the cox that's sis is

actually seacocks uh i don't know him

the cox that i know and hate is m cox

who i thankfully have not seen in a

while

um

that idiot that i used to be soulmates

with dean he claimed that when he went

to the shoe uh checked in that one time

the sis cox told him i'm gonna put you

with someone who [ __ ] little boys in

the ass i hope he [ __ ] you in the ass

and then put him in a cell with a child

molester in the shoe but

uh i

99 of the [ __ ] coming out of dean's

mouth was completely [ __ ] so oh yeah

he was a mental patient so he was he was

stupid yeah i don't

yeah

uh ronald mckenna i don't know if he was

here when you were here he's the one

that's over white white cells

oh really he's in the unit with you

yeah

okay

all right

well

that's about it then i hope this you

guys can hear this and this is a long

video i know we'll see how it goes so

look

um

the medium [medium.com](http://medium.com/) man

just the pictures that he put up in this

article

so anyway again

joshua goldberg you guys heard him

talking i hope you guys enjoyed this i

hope it turns out all right we'll see

um

but if you want to do a deeper dive on

this guy's background

um

yeah real real

real interesting character

and what i was saying is he thinks that

his life's ruined because he got a

terrorist label and he wasn't trying to

entice people to make bombs or whatever

and he goes into the details on his

website and i don't say that lightly i'm

saying

did he want him to you know what

probably i don't know that but i'm

saying

he was so into the personas and making

things you know causing chaos and just

just that's what he did um kind of

liking the mob tube stuff how uh people

go back and forth at each other and get

all drummed out but they get like more

views and you know anyway all right

that's about it uh let me matter of fact

let me see if you guys can see some of

these pictures no i won't do that

alright i'm going i hope you enjoyed
