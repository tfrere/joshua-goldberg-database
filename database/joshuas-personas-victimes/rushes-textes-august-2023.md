[r/conspiracy - Joshua Ryne Goldberg, AKA 'Australi Witness', who acted as an ISIS recruiter, is set to be declared insane today](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3wsqte/joshua_ryne_goldberg_aka_australi_witness_who/)

## Justice Court Document

### Summarize judgment

[MDFL] Joshua Ryne Goldberg of Orange Park, Florida, was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, to be followed by a lifetime of supervised release, for attempted malicious damage and destruction by an explosive of a building. Goldberg pleaded guilty on Dec. 20, 2017. According to the plea agreement, in the summer of 2015, the FBI and law enforcement officers from Australia began investigating the online name "AusWitness" and determined that it was Goldberg. He had come to the attention of law enforcement due in part to his postings concerning the May 3, 2015, attack by two gunmen at the Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest in Garland, Texas. Prior to the attack, Goldberg posted a map of the location of the contest and urged anyone in the area to attack the event. Goldberg's posting was copied by gunman Elton Simpson, one of the two individuals killed during the May 3, 2015, attack. The FBI later located an online posting in which Goldberg took responsibility for inspiring the Garland attack, as well as two other planned attacks.
