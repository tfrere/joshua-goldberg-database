**AFP Federal Agent (mohamadmo7)**

good to see you back on here brother! the kuffar wouldnâ€™t have a clue! :P

**AusWitness**

lndeed, brother. The kuffar have no ldea about this account. They are powerless to stop me.

**AFP Federal Agent**

for me your posts were quite interesting. my parents moved to Australia before i was born and adopted the western way. i hate them for this.

**AusWitness**

Yes, my parents are coconuts as well. They would be very angry if they knew I was a mujahid, as
they support the Western kaflr governments.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i like the coconut reference brother! my parents are from Egypt and forced me to grow up on a western kafir lifestyle!

I have to learn islam on my own!

but same with me, they donâ€™t know how i feel and would kill me. any help is appreciated brother =)

**AusWitness**

I grew up the same way, brother. My parents are frorn Lebanon, and they raised me to be a kafir. I
had to learn real Islam on my own.

Is there anything I can help you with, brother? l live in Perth.

**AFP Federal Agent**

exactly the same way. i have grown up with western kafir brainwash and i can see this now as i get
older,

i guess for me I want to reclaim my Islamic heritage which was stolen from me

you know?         

    

any good sites to read etc?

im in Melbourne by the way

**AusWitness**      '

I understand completely, brother. I have dedicated my life to serving real Islam, and no kafir is
ever going to stop me.

Here is oneÂ·of the best Islamic blogs: .ansarukhilafah wordpress corn

Here is a very helpful guide for making hijrah to the Islamic State: .ia801509 us.arcl,ive
org/9/iterns/Hijrah

**AFP Federal Agent**

thank you for the information brother! Iâ€™ll have a read of those - have you ever thought of making hijrah to the Islamic State?

**AusWitness**     

Yes, but I believe that it would be better if both of us carry out jihad on Australian shores. Do
you have a gun, brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

sorry brother havenâ€™t checked my twitter, your wordpress is very informative, i havenâ€™t really thought about carrying out a jihad here

what have you got ln mind?? i don't have a gun but my brother's friend ara pretty shadey characters - maybe they have one haha

are you all good brother?? i thought the kuffar may have shut this down too! inshallah 

**AusWitness**

I am good, brother. Sorry for the delay. And we need to carry out jihad against Jews. There are
many synagogues in Melbourne to target.

**AFP Federal Agent**

I am interested but, want to do it right. i don't even know how to start organising something like
this. what are you planning brother?

**AusWitness**

When I get a gun, I plan to at attack a mosque in Perth. All you need is to find a crowded synagogue
with minimal guards & open fire.

Here are the synagogues in Melbourne: .maven [co.il/synagogues/C33](http://co.il/synagogues/C33)...  Go to one & shoot as many
Jews as you can, brother. Jews are the worst kuffar.

**AFP Federal Agent**

brother, i think you mean a synagogue not a mosqueâ€¦.

do you think something like this would be have a greater impact if we were to coordinate it at the same time ?

multiple attacks like this will surely strike fear into the hearts of the kuffar. inshallah

brother, is it safe to have these conversations on twitter?

i am scared of being caught before i carry out jihad like my other brothers here in Melbourne

**AusWitness**

Yes, I meant a synagogue. Sorry, brother. And yes, it is safe. The kuffar don't know about this
account.

I agree, we should wage jihad around the same time. When do you think the right lime would be? I
think we should do it this month.

Will you be able to get a gun soon, brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

i havenâ€™t heard from you for a long time brother, i was getting worried. what has been happening with you?

I have sourced some guns from my brother's friend i was telling you about. he has sent me a link to
some photos of the guns on photo bucket

i have had a look at them but I do not know what i am looking at. one of them is a shotgun and the
other is an SKS rifle??

do you know about guns? l do not know anything, please provide me with some advice brother about
which one would  be more suitable.

here is the link to the photos bit.ly/1FAgvEg

my friend wants $300 for the shotgun and $1000 for the rifle

to be a shaheed i have to repay my debts before i do this.

i have a car that i can sell that might be worth $2000 but i have some debts to settle with my family before i do this.

i am sorry brother. have you been able to get a gun?

**AusWitness**

The SKS rifle would be better for killing the maximum amount of kuffar.

I am sorry, but I have very little money at the moment. I can barely even pay for my Internet.
That's why it keeps going out.

Once I can get the money, I will buy a gun and kill Jews in Perth.

**AFP Federal Agent**

is it possible to chat with you at a time when we are both online? i have many questions for you brother and no one to answer them.

do you know others that have been a martyr and carried out the will of god and ascended to paradise?

**AusWitness**

If you like, we can meet on IRC.

Yes, I know many martyrs, brother. I actually inspired the two mujahideen in Texas: s11111 co111
au/federal-politi

**AFP Federal Agent**

You were talking with those two shaheeds?

IRC? what is that?

**AusWitness**

Yes, brother. I inspired both of them to carry out their attacks. I even tweeted out a map to the
location of the antiÂ­ lslam event.

IRC is a chatroom thing.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have not used it before. what about Skype?

have you thought about your plans for jihad in detail?

**AusWitness**

IRC is much easier, brother. and it's totally anonymous. And yes, I have. I plan to shoot up a
local synagogue in Perth.

I only have a few minutes of battery left on my laptop at the moment.

**AFP Federal Agent**

maybe we can chat at this time on IRC then tomottow night brother?

**AusWitness**

Yes, I will try to do that. We can talk about our plans there. Goodnight, brother.

**AFP Federal Agent**

goodnight my friend

**AusWitness**

Tomorrow around 9:30 PM, right?

**AFP Federal Agent**

pm ok?

**AusWitness**

Yes, that sounds okay.

NEXT DAY

**AusWitness**

Are you there, brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes brother i am here

how are you?

**AusWitness**

I am fine. Would you like to speak to me on IRC now?

**AFP Federal Agent**

is it ok for us to continue to talk on twitter?

i did some research on IRC and I amusing a mac. IRC will not work on a mac, is that right?

**AusWitness**

It should work if you connect online. Go here: .k1wiirc com/cl1en

Sorry, wrong link. Here: .kiwiirc corn/client Ãœnder Nickname, put mohamadmo7. Under Channel, put
#mohamadrno. Then click "Start".

**AFP Federal Agent**

ok hold on a minute, stay on twiller as well in case i cannot get it to work. sorry i am not very
technical with computers.

**AusWitness**

It looks like it's not letting me use proxies on it. I think we should just keep talking on here
for now.

**AFP Federal Agent**

ok. what is a proxy, is that like TOR?

**AusWitness**

Yes. Proxies hide your location. lt wonâ€™t let me use Tor or proxies.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i want to talk to you about jihad

**AusWitness**

I would like to talk about jihad as well.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have told you that this has been something that i have been thinking about for a long time now, i just donâ€™t know what to do.

**AusWitness**

Now is the time for jihad, brother. Allah (SWT) commands us to strike fear into the hearts of the
kuffar.

Remember that the Jews killed the Rasul (SAW) & he died as a shaheed.

If we really love the Prophet (PBUH), we must carry out jihad against Jews to avenge his death.

**AFP Federal Agent**

I understand this

he who commits suicide kills himself for his own benefit, he who commits martyrdom sacrifies
himself for the sake of his religion and his

nationâ€¦ the mujahed is full of hope

how are we supposed to coordinate this brother?

**AusWitness**

lt's easy, brother. All you need is a gun. I have found a way to get one myself. My cousin has one
that he'II give me later this week.

Once I see on the news that you have carried out your attack, I will carry out mine.

**AFP Federal Agent**

This does not make sense, we should do it at the same time

didn't  you  say  that  we  would do  it  at  the  same  time?

i will not have the money this week brother as i told  you before  i need to sell my  car

**AusWitness**

At the exact same time? I thought I was gonna do it right after you did it.

But we can do it at the exact same time. I can use Twitter on my phone.

I just got a new phone from a relative.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have many questions. what day of the week? what time of the day?

brother what is wrong with your internet? is it because of these proxies you are using. i cannot sit here all night waiting for you to reply

why do you not use your phone to message me on twitter? it will be just as fast and twitter is also anonymous

**AusWitness**

Hold on. I am researching when the most Jews are at synagogue.

**AFP Federal Agent**

jews worship everyday, three times a day

**AusWitness**

We should target when the Jews are worshiping.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i thought you had thought this through and had a plan?

**AusWitness**

i do have it figured out. I just hadn't set an exact time.

**AFP Federal Agent**

what sort of gun are you getting from your cousin?

**AusWitness**

He told me it's a semi-automatic rifle.

I can target a synagogue in Perth at the same time.

I found something to target, when many Jews will be there: caoJlfieldsÃ¯ule corn au/calendar event

I can target a synagogue in Perth at the same time.

**AFP Federal Agent**

this coming saturday?

                    

this  is not much time to make preparations brother

**AusWitness**

I can find a later event if you need me to, but this seemed like a perfect event to strike. Tons of
Jews will be there.

**AFP Federal Agent**

I will pray about it tonight. are you on twiltter on your phone during the day? so that I can discuss
with you i need to

**AusWitness**

When would you like to discuss it? I can get on whenever you need me to.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i also use an encrypted chat app on my phone to talk to other mujahid in syria, it is called sure spot. have you used this?

**AusWitness**

lt's not available on my phone. Sorry, brother

**AFP Federal Agent**

what phone do you have?

**AusWitness**

lt's an old Nokia.

**AFP Federal Agent**

what about your new phone? it is very safe.

**AusWitness**

The old Nokia is the one my relative gave me. I think it's from a few years ago.

**AFP Federal Agent**

ok, i will message you again on twitter tomorrow morning brother. there are many thoughts swirling
around in my head tonight.

i will try to get some rest now. goodnight, thank you for talking with me.

**AusWitness**

No problem, brother. I hope we can coordinate this for Saturday. Good luck, and may Allah (SWT)
bless you. Goodnight.

NEXT DAY

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother, i am sorry i have not been in contact with you for a while. i have been out looking
al some of the locations you provided me

i am unsure whether they would be the right places to undertake jihad. some of them have very good
security, it would be suicide

i have been doing a lot of reading about martyrdom and I want to ensure lhat i ascend to paradise

and not burn in the hell fire for committing an act of suicide. what are your thoughts on this brother?

i am readig that there is a difference between fighting to the death....... and conducting a
suicide mission in   Allah's   name (PBUH)

suicide is considered the most reprehensible deed for which the eward is it to burn in the
hellfire, this I am afraid of

**AusWitness**

Brother, it is not suicide if you are martyred in battle with the enemies of Allah (SWT). The Jews
are the enemies of Allah (S\IVT).

What we need is to target synagogues that have minimal security.

Remember that the Jews killed the Rasul (SAW) & he died a shaheed.

lf we truly love the Prophet {PBUH), we must engage in jihad against Jews to avenge the Rasul's
(SAW) death.

Did this event have too much security? caulf:elcfshule com au/calendar-evenl

This place has Shabbat morning services starting at 9:30 AM Saturday: e. h1latnÂ·1za11orÂ·g a
1/woÂ·srnp hh1I It would be a good target. Many Jews there.

Also, I don't think they have very much security.

**AFP Federal Agent**

good evening brother, i am going out to a farm on the weekend to test fire the rifle. i do not have
the money to buy it at this time

i would like to be familiar with using it though

how are you going in obtaining a gun?

**AusWitness**

I got the gun, brother. Do you know when you will be able to purchase your gun?

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother, i am still trying to get the money together. i have a fmily member who may be willing to buy my car

do you have a photo of the gun? do you know how to use it?

good morning brother, what are your plans for today?

i will send you a video of me shooting the rifle

are you able to send me a black shahada flag? i don't know where I would find one.  

i am not going to ask around for fear that it would draw attention to me

**AusWitness**

Here is my gun: .i imgur.comfP:520CcAh jpg I know how to use it. Black shahada flags can be bought
online, or you could make one.

Are you prepared for jihad, brother? I have everything I need.

**AFP Federal Agent**

good evening brother, i still have some things to sort out, but everything is coming together

i went to a farm today and shot the SKS lifte. il was working but had a couple of misfires, i am
told it is the ammunition,

is it old or something?? the seller told me that he would service the rifle and get out some new bullets.

i have some video footage which i will send to you later. do not show anyone this video please.

there are a lot of people around my house tonight. i will contact you tomorrow. sleep well brother.

**AusWitness**

My gun is an AR-180. Get the seller to service the rifle and get new bullets, then buy it. 

Don't worry, I wiII not show anyone the video footage. Will you have the SKS by Friday?

NEXT DAY

**AFP Federal Agent**

good morning brother, i hope you have been well

i had a look at the AR-180 on google too. that looks like a serious gun. have you also had a chance to test fire this??

the seller tells me he is working on the misfire problem. i should be heading back out there today to have another test 
fire with new

ammunition

he still has not sent me the video but i'II take one on my phone today and send as soon as i can

**AusWitness**

Yes, I test fired my gun. It works perfectly. Did you have another test fire with yours?

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother, couldnâ€™t get out to the property yesterday. i had two people come around to look at my car.

i will not be ready by Friday. i am desperately trying to sell my car to get enough money to buy
the gun.

Unless you have other suggestions to get the money more quickly brother? l am going to need more
time to coordinate this

we need to have a conversation about the details for planning this jihad to maximise the effect. i still
have not chosen a suitable location

we also need to discuss how we are going to coordinate this at the same time. i feel that you might be rushing this without more thought

planning for this consumes my every waking minute but i feel like i am doing this without any guidance

may Allah (SWT) reward me for my intentions.

**AusWitness**

I understand. brother. Did you look at the last link I sent you, which has the Shabbat services?
Thal seems like a good target.

When the day cornes, we will meet on here at 9:00 AM, and we will give each other the go-ahead.

As far as making money goes, is there anything else you could sell?

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have some good news brother, a family member has given me a desposit for my car

yes i did have a look at the Shabbat services link. i am going to go and have a look on Saturday

i finally have that video of us test firing  the gun. lt is still not functioning properly as soon as possible bit.ly/1cXS0gA

**AusWitness**

Thank you, brother. We need to do this soon, before any kuffar discover our plans.

Do you have the money to buy the gun now?

Are you there, brother? Did you have a look at the synagogue I showed you?

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes i am, sorry brother. i hope you are well. there have been a lot of people around my house. have been trying to keep to myself.

i agree, it needs to happen soon. it has just been hard for me to get the money so quick.

i am happy that i got the $200 deposit from my family member. she said that she will hopefully have the entire amount by next weekend =)

then i can buy the gun

i did look at the synagogue. that looks like a  good place brother. very busy.

**AusWitness**

I am  so glad to hear, brother. So, we will be launching our attacks on Saturday the 27th at 9:30
AM. correct?

I have found the perfect place to target in Perth, where many Jews will be.

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes my brother. Things are looking good. I hope that Allah (SWT) will bless me and that i will get
the money by next weekend to buy the gun.

inshallah

you  have  not  said  anything  about  the  video brother?

great news about the Perth target. where are you thinking?

**AusWitness**

I saw the video, brother. lt's a very impressive gun. l'm very glad you were able to obtain it.

I will be targeting this place when the day comes: dianellashule.com

Will you have the gun by Saturday the 27th?

Are you there, brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes, brother i am here sorry, as i have said, i can only get on to this twitter account at certain times as i dont want any family members

to question what im doing.

it is a very powerful gun and will cut the filthy kuffar in half!

thank you for the link brother. i had a look at the dianella shule and that looks like a good target.

im just worried that I wont be able to get the gun by saturday. my family member is coming to my house on sunday to actually give me the

money and take the car. then i can get back in contact with the seller and buy the gun. does that sound ok??

**AusWitness**

Yes, brother, that sounds okay. What day do you think you'll be able to get the gun?

We need to do this as quickly as possible. I don't want ASIO finding us before we can pull this off.

**AFP Federal Agent**

good morning brother. well im hoping that i will get all of the money this weekend, maybe sunday but
i will let you know exacty. inshallah

i agree brother. it needs to be done soon. but its hard for a young brother with not much money.
are you still planning for this saturday ??

i have been doing a lot of thinking about the security of twitter. i dont want to get caught by also either.

i saw this link too

i think i will only use surespot from now on brother..

**AusWitness**

Brother, I do not have a phone that can use Surespot. The kuffar don't know about this Twitter
account. so it's safe for us to talk here.

Let's attack on Monday, after you get the gun. I want to do this quickly and we need to attack on
the same day.

On second thought, let's attack NEXT Saturday. Saturday, July 3rd, at 9:30 AM. when the Jews are
having Shabbat.

How does that sound, brother? You'II have the gun by July 3rd, right?

Did you get the gun, akhi?

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother, sorry about the long reply again, i was very busy on the weekend with family things.
i hope you have been well

i did sell my car yesterday. finally!! so 1 have around $1800 because i spent a little bit of the
deposit. very good news.

i havent been able to get the gun yet. the seller is taking a litlle while to get back to me. I sent
him another text earlier.

the mujahideen I am speaking to in syria are telling me to get off twitter brother. i think you
should reconsider surespot.

now that i have money, i can send you my old iphone???

**AusWitness**

Will you have the gun by Saturday, brother? That's when I want us to attack.

I use Tor when I go on Twitter, sa the kuffar can't get my real IP address. Do you use Tor,
brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

are you there brother?

what if twitter shut down our accounts because of what we were talking about? how will we contact eachother??

**AusWitness**

Brother, Twitter cannot see our private messages. There is nothing to be worried about. Also, we
have each other's emails addresses.

Our direct messages to each other are private. Nobody can see our private messages. We just can't
tweet about this publicly.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have been doing some researching about tor. maybe I should start using that. does that just hide the
ip address for your internet??

is that all youâ€™re using brother?

im only worried because i keep hearing that twitter isnt the safest place to chat

i understand what you said though brother

also brother, i have been working  a video to upload to youtube when we do the attacks. i'II hopefully have
something to show you soon.

**AusWitness**

I think we are safe. ASIO has no idea we're going to attack soon, and neither does anyone else. We
attack this Saturday, right?

You will have the gun by Saturday, right, brother? Because I really think we need to attack this
Saturday, July 3rd.

**AFP Federal Agent**

ok brother, well in that case i might start using tor to hide my ip address, just incase, do you think so??

brother i want to commit to this saturday but i do not think im ready yet. i still havent got the gun and im not much use without it.

the seller is taking ages to respond! i will call him today and get out there asap to buy it

another brother that i am speaking to on surespot suggested that i do the attack with someone else in melbourne. what do you think?

**AusWitness**

Yes, brother, all mujahideen should use Tor to stay anonymous.

I really want to attack this Saturday, brother. I have the whole thing planned out. Please try to
gel the gun ASAP.

Do you know anyone else in Melbourne who couId attack with you? I still want to attack in Perth on
the same day you attack in Melbourne.

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes brother I have been talking with other mujahedeen on sure spot and they have put me in contact
with brothers in melbourne

some of these brothers have been talking about the â€œBook of Terror". do you have access to this book? 

i cannot find it anywhere on the net.

**AusWitness**

I don't know what that is, brother. I have never even heard of it. l'm sorry.

Do you have the gun, brother?

I would really like to carry out the attacks this Saturday, when the Jews are having their Shabbat
services.

I got an iPad and downloaded Surespot, brother. My username is AusWitness. Is your username
mohamadmo7?

Brother, it is almost Saturday. Do you have the gun?

Brother, are you okay? I have not heard from you in days.

Okay, I am really getting worried about you. Are you still there? Please respond tome to let me now
you're okay.

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother.  yes i am ok. lm very sorry about the delay. i just havent been online to be honest. sorry that we could not do saturday.

i have been out at the farm during the weekend with the selelr. and good news, i now have the gun!!

good news about surespot! much better and safer place to talk i think.

did u want to chat on there instead?

and yes sorry brother, my username on surespot is the same

**AusWitness**

I am so glad to hear you got the gun, brother! I sent you some messages on Surespot. Please respond
ASAP.

Brother. have you been getting my messages on Surespot? I have not heard from you in days.

Brother, it has been a WEEK since l've heard from you. Why are you not online or on Surespot? Have
you been captured by the kuffar?

Do you stiII check your Twitter, akhi?

**AFP Federal Agent**

Salam akhi. I check it but i am trying not to use it because its riddled with kuffar. Ma salamah.

**AusWitness**

I would like to chat with you on this secure, encrypted chatroom, brother: ..chatcrypt.com

Can we organise a time to chat?

Brother, where are you? You have not been on Surespot in a week. Is your Surespot working?

Brother, it has been three weeks since I have heard from you. Where are you?

Brother, it has again been a week since l've heard from you. I get very worried when I don't hear
from you, akhi. Please get on Surespot.

Brother, if your Surespot is not working, then we need to go back to talking to each other on here.

Akhi. please download kik and add me on there. l'm AusWitness.

you too but he didnâ€™t want to

*13/07/2015, 11:58 am*

should I ask again brother??
*13/07/2015, 11:59 am*

**AustraliWitness**                 
I am sorry if I sounded upset, brother. I was just very worried that you had been captured by the
kuffar. Next time you go away for a few days, just please tell me about beforehand so I donâ€™t worry.

*13/07/2015, 3:26 pm*

     
How will the Melbourne brother get involved if he doesnâ€™t have a gun?
*13/07/2015, 3:28 pm*

I really want to pull off the attack this Saturday, brother. We cannot keep delaying it. Can you
commit to this Saturday, around 9:30 AM?

*13/07/2015, 3:44 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
No problem brother that was my mistake. i will let you know, next lime that I wont be online for a
while. just hard when family members are next to me.

*13/07/2015, 3:45 pm*

how is your planning going? anything new?
*13/07/2015, 3:45 pm*

my melboume brother is pretty much only speaking with me, we went to school together, so he trusts
me.
*13/07/2015, 3:46 pm*

he will be good. very motivated. he is trying to get a weapon so im trying to direct him to my
seller too.

*13/07/2015, 3:46 pm*

he doesnt know why we want to larget Jews though??

*13/07/2015, 3:46 pm*

brother the only reason i havent done it on my own is because I want to plan for something much
bigger. especially with my other brother 

i want to do a video, with a shahada flag, maybe even wait for a big event to attack

*13/07/2015, 3:47 pm*

and we can do all of this together?? i just dont want to rush it for no reason

*13/07/2015, 3:49 pm*

ill be back on later, talk soon brother. inshallah

*13/07/2015, 3:49 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Brother, l've got it all planned out. Right before we attack, im going to mail letters filled with
deadly ricin to several Australian politicians.

*13/07/2015, 4:07 pm*

The Jews killed the Rasul {SAW) and he died a shaheed. So, if we truly love the Prophet (PBUH), then
we need to attack the Jews to avenge the Rasulâ€™s (SAW) death.

*13/07/2015, 4:08 pm*

If we both attack together this Saturday, it wiII be the biggest attack in Australian history. We
don't need to wait several more months. We need to attack this Saturday, while the Jews are
having shabbat. Trust me, brother. Large eventss have lots of security, but the synagogues have no
security right now. so we can easily kill tons of kuffar.

*13/07/2015, 4:10 pm*

ls your gun dealer on Surespot or Twitter, brother? I know some mujahideen who want to buy guns,
but I don't know any dealers. I got my gun from a relative.

*13/07/2015, 4:13 pm*

Brother, I understand what you want to do. You want us to pull of a 9/11 calibre, attack and kill
thousands of kuffar. But thatâ€™s just not possible right now. Please consider it, brother. We cannot wait any longer.  If we both shoot up synagogues and l send ricin to politicians, it will still be the biggest attack Australia has ever seen. Please consider it, brother. We cannot wait any longer. If we keep delaying this, the kuffar wiII find us and stop us before we can attack.

*13/07/2015, 7:55 pm*

This Saturday is the PERFECT day to attack, akhi. Pulling off this allack right after Ramadan ends
would send a much stronger message to the kuffar, and would ensure us a place in Jannah.

*13/07/2015, ?*

Brother, are you there?

*14/07/2015, ?* 

Brother, I have important news. I have made a deal with a mujahid in Sydney. The mujahid is
willing to attack with us this SaIurday. But, if we donâ€™t attack this Saturday, he plans to make hijrah to Syria. You HAVE to commit to this Satwday, brother. You attack in Melbourne, this brother  attacks in Sydney, I mail ricin to politicians, then I attack in Perth.

*14/07/2015,, 6:57 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
brother, sorry im not on the internet every moment of the day. You need t0 be a little bit more patient with me!!I Please understand brother.

*14/07/2015, 9:23 pm*

Why politicians? that sounds like it would cause  alot of damage ! How did you get the ricin? Iâ€™ll
have to google what that is

*14/07/2015, 9:25 pm*

my seller for guns is not on surespot brother, i am sorry. did you want me to ask what he can get then
let you know?

*14/07/2015, 9:27 pm*

lm not wanting to wait several months brother. you are reading me wrong. I need to make sure that I do
this right so i ascend to paradise.

*14/07/2015, 9:29 pm*

i want to make a video and have a long standing message to the kuffar and the world. i was even
thinking of doing a seige at the event.

*14/07/2015, 9:30 pm*

you cannot worry about the kuffar finding out. i dont see how they could even know? i have taken a lot
of security tips from you and even have a pre paid sim for internet

*14/07/2015, 9:32 pm*

that is good news about the sydney mujahid brother! i will let my melbourne brother know. maybe he
will be interested for us to get ready quicker. did you find him on surespot? Is he targeting a synagogue too?
*14/07/2015, 9:37 pm*

very interesting brother. exactly the coordination i have been speaking about!

*14/07/2015, 9:39 pm*

i must go! come back online tomorrow. sleep well and good night akhi

*14/07/2015, 9:39 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
I apologise, brother. Itâ€™s just that we really need to keep in regular contact with each other. I am sorry if I sounded impatient.

*14/07/2015, 10:09 pm*

Democracy is the system of shirk and kuffar, and these politicians fund wars against our Muslim
brothers around the world. They are the agents of Shaytan.

*14/07/2015,  10:10 pm*

What event are you refering to, brother? Big events always have lots of security. A mujahid did a siege in Sydney last year, but hardly any kuffar were killed. If we shoot up synagogues, we could kill tons of kuffar.

*14/07/2015, 10:12 pm*

I got the ricin through a fellow mujahid. He also introduced me to the Sydney mujahid. The Sydney mujahid isnâ€™t on Surespot at the moment, but he has promised that, if we attack this Saturday, he will attack right after us on the same day. He also said he has a video prepared, so you donâ€™t need to worry about making one.

*14/07/2015, 10:13 pm*

We must attack this Saturday, though. If we donâ€™t, the Sydney mujahid said he would make hijrah to Syria instead.

*14/07/2015, 10:15 pm*

Hereâ€™s how it will happen: get your phone and drive to the synagogue. Make sure itâ€™s busy. Then, get on Surespot and tell me youâ€™re about to attack. The, get your gun out of your car, go in, and kill as many kuffar as possible. I will then mail the ricin and attack a synagogue in Perth. Then, the Sydney mujahid will upload the video and attack a synagogue in Sydney. I have it all planned out, brother. But it must happen this Saturday. Goodnight, akhi. Please get on tomorrow. We only have a few days left, and we must stay in contact with each other.

*14/07/2015, 10:17 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
no problem brother, i know you just want to have everything sorted out. i understand. im just trying to be cautious so that my parents do not find out whats going on. so i speak to you and other brothers when its the safest time.

*16/07/2015, 2;23 pm*

well, we have been discussing a larger style evnt somewhere in the city but i know your interested in a synagogue. i dont really know where yet. i have just been looking and keeping an eye out. my melbourne brother keeps telling me that he doesnt want to do a synagogue. im still discussing further plans with him.

*16/07/2015, 2:25 pm*

i dont really think that there will be much security in the melbourne cbd?? there never is. let me get back to you on that

*16/07/2015, 2:26 pm*

have you spoken further to your sydney brother??

*16/07/2015, 2:27 pm*

would i be able to see his video akhi??

*16/07/2015, 2:27 pm*

i will hopefully be back on later tonight. thanks for sending through a bit more on your plan / what you were thinking. im just afraid that me and my melbourne brother wont be ready by saturday. im trying

*16/07/2015, 2:29 pm*

may allah (swt) bless this and allow it to happen. speak later.

*16/07/2015, 2 :29 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Large events always have at least some security, brother. At any large event, there will be cops
But, at the synagogues, there are no cops and no guards. There is nobody to stop us from killing tons of kuffar easily.

*16/07/2015, 2:55 pm*

Every time a mujahid tries to larget a large evem, he gets caught beforehand. Remember those
mujahid who planned to target Anzac Day, but gor caught before they could? The most successful
attacks always happen on random days 9/11, 7/7, and Charlie Hebdo didnâ€™t target any specific events.
 They were so successful because they happened randomlly and the kuffar were totally
unprepared for them.

*16/07/2015, 2:57 pm*

The Sydney brother hasn't shown me his video because we only speak at the phone and he says he
can't risk the video getting out before itâ€™s time. However, l trust him because he is a
very skilled mujahid and he has lots of experience.

*16/07/2015, 3:00 pm*

Didnâ€™t you say your Melbourne brother didnâ€™t have a gun, akhi? How is he going to attack with us, if he
doesn't have a gun? It could take him months to get a gun.

*16/07/2015, 3:01 pm*

We have spent more than a month preparing this, brother. This Saturday is the day we finally strike.

*16/07/2015, 3:02 pm*

By the way, I also have a mujahid on Los Angeles who promises to attack a synagogue there  if we att

*16/07/2015, 3:16 pm*

attack in Australia. He already has a gun and everything, but he told me he'II only attack if we
attack first.

*16/07/2015, 3:17 pm*

I really need you to commit to this Saturday, akhi. If we dont attack this Saturday, the Sydney
mujahid will not be able to attack with us. This is a perfect oppotunity we have, and we canâ€™t waste
it. Please consider, akhi. We can pull off the biggest attack in Australian history together, if we do
it this Saturday.

*16/07/2015, 3:19 pm*

We aren't going to have an opportunity like this again, akhi. The Sydney mujahid is a trained expert in firearms, and he will kill dozens of kuffar. But it will only happen if we attack this Saturday. We cannot wait any longer. If we do not attack this Saturday, the Sydney mujahid will leave for Syria.

*16/07/2015, 4:28 pm*

Brother, it is almost Saturday. We attack around 9:30 AM on Saturday. Please tell me you are ready. The Sydney mujahid is counting on us. All you have to is load up your gun, take it to the synagogue, then go in and shoot as manu kuffar as possible. I will do everything else. Remember, Brother : I have been coordinating this for over a month. I have everything planned out for Saturday, and so does the Sydney mujahid.

*17/07/2015, 12:55 pm*

Thereâ€™s another reason why Saturday is the perfect day to attack, brother : all of the police will be too busy guarding those anti-Islam rallies. They wonâ€™t be able to stop us from killing Jewish kuffar in the synagogues. We only have a few hours left, akhi. Please donâ€™t back out of this. We wonâ€™t have this kind of opportunity again.

*17/07/2015, 7:40 pm*

I am going to sleep now, akhi. I have evreything set up to attack in a few hours. Please, I am begging you - do not back out of this. We have a golden opportunity here to carry out the biggest attack in Australian history.  We need to attack aroung 9:30 AM. I have my gun ready, my ricin ready to be mailed, and the Sydney mujahid has the video ready to be posted.

*18/07/2015, 1:04 am*

Brother, it is almost time to attack. I got up very early and spent hours making sure evrything was perfect. The Sydney mujahid is counting on us to do this today. He is going to be so angry at me if you back down from this, akhi. We can pull off an attack that will leave the kuffar on their knees, but you need to be willing to help me. I cannot do this on my own. We all need to work together to make this happen. Please, brother, I am begging you - PLEASE do not disappoint me.

*18/07/2015, 8:29 am*

Brother, you need to attack RIGHT NOW. Why are you not on Surespot?

*18/07/2015, 10:07 am*

I cannot possibly express in words how disappointed I am, akhi. The Sydney mujahid is now furious at me, and is threatening to have me killed.

*18/07/2015 10:31 am*

Where are you? The Sydney mujahid left for Syria, but he said he might have some of this friends in Australia kill me. I am honestly frightened, brother. What if I get killed before we are able to carry out jihad? We had the perfect chance last Saturday, but you never got on here.

21*/07/2015, 3:43 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
Akhi, i am so sorry. I didnt receive any of your messages on surespot. my profile was wiped clean on
here. i dont know what happened!! Im so mad. I know you are probably mad for me not following through on Saturday

*22/07/2015, 1:33 pm*

I understand if you dont want to use me anymore for the attack. im sorry if you went there without me coming online. This stupid app. maybe its too secure

*22/07/2015, 1:35 pm*

me and my melbourne brother are still wanting to kill plenty of dirty kuffar. i guess for me it has just taken alot longer than planned.

*22/07/2015, 1:38 pm*

very frustrating. I had my gun and was set. now i am the one waiting

*22/07/2015,  1:40 pm*

Inshallah i hope this happens soon

*22/07/2015, 1:41 pm*

Sorry

*22/07/2015, 1:41 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
It's okay, brother, if your account was wiped, then it isnâ€™t your fault. I would still like to
carry out jihad with you. Can you commit to this Salurday, brother? I still have my gun and my
ricin.

*22/07/2015, 1:47pm*

ls there a way I can communicate with you more quickly, and where I can
be sure you'll receive my messages? Like Kik or WhatsApp?
*22/07/2015, 2:11 pm*

We really need to do this as soon as possible, brother. We cannot wait any longer. We need to do it
this Saturday, around 9:30 AM.

*22/07/2015,  4:51 pm*

I think the kuffar might now about our plans, akhi. They may have deliberately messed up your
Surespot account to prevent you from talking to me. We HAVE to do this soon, brother. I am begging
you please - commit to this Saturday.

*22/07/2015, 9:13 pm*

We can still do this, but we HAVE to do it this Saturday, brother. We cannot keep delaying this. If we
keep delaying this, we will get caught. We have spent months preparing this, akhi. It's time for us
to finally strike. Remember this Saturday at 9Â·30 AM. Can you commit to that, brother?

*22/07/2015, 9:46 pm*

Brother, are you on here? We need to stay in contact with each other.

*23/07/2015, 3:16 pm*

Akhi, I am really, really trying to be patient, but I have spent weeks and weeks waiting. You
already have the gun. There is no reason not  to carry out the attack this Saturday. Please,
brother - please get on Surespot and commit to this Saturday. We cannot keep delaying this over and
over again.

*23/07/2015, 6:15 pm*

Brother, if we are going to coordinate this, you have to be on Surespot more than just once a week.
This is very frustrating for me, as l've had everything ready for weeks now, but you are never
online. Please understand that I am really trying to be as patient as I possibly can.

*24/07/2015, 2:39 pm*

It is almost Saturday. I really hope we can pull this off in a few hours, akhi. Please get back to me
ASAP.

*24/07/2015, 6:46 pm*

Brother, are you receiving my messages? I has once again been several days since I last heard from
you. We only have a few hours untiI we need to attack, akhi. If Surespot isn't working
for you, then we need to use a different app.

*24/07/20159:26 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
Assalam alaikom akhi, my surespot is working. I realised the problem was that i had my  account
backed up on my phone but now it is Google drive. Apparently that can prevent losing
information.

*25/07/2015, 9;47 am*

Akhi Im sorry but i am just not ready and conoketely completely prepared to commir Jihad until my
melbourne brother is ready. I would not be a good muslim if i didnâ€™t give him a chance to become a
Shaheed with me.

*25/07/2015, 9:49 am*

We are very long friends and he is committed. He wants to use a nife to be able to cut up the
kuffar, inshallah that can happen soon

*25/07/2015, 9:50 am*

I know you said your sydney brother made a vidÃ©o but i want to make it and send my strong message
to the kuffar. The same kuffar that stripped islam from me.

*25/07/2015, 9:51 am*

Subhanallah this is so important to me. And it needs to be done correctly for me to become a Shaheed and rise to jannah. I hope Allah swt
brings me blessings

*25/07/2015, 9:53 am*

Akhi you have been very patient. Thank you and i am sotty for the strain. This
struggle adds to your jihad.

*25/07/2015, 9:55 am*

La hawla wala quwata illa billah alâ€™allii al azeem

*25/07/2015, 9:56 am*

The kuffar cannot be on sure spot? Its encrypted akhi? Please dont stress about that

*25/07/2015, 9:57 am*

I do however promise to be on more and keep you updated. I have been trying to work and earn more
money

*25/07/2015, 9:58 am*

I want a black shahada flag for my video

*25/07/2015, 9;59 am*

Alhamdu lillah akhi

*25/07/2015, 10:00 am*

**AustraliWitness**
I understand, akhi. But how long will it take for you and your Melbourne brother to get ready? I just really want the attack to happen soon, because I donâ€™t want us to get caught.

*25/07/2015, 1:30 pm*

Does your Melbourne brother have a knife already?

*25/07/2015, 1:31 pm*

Do you have a safe way to obtain a black,shahada flag? I donâ€™t want you to get caught while buying
one, akhi.

*25/07/2015, 1:37 pm*

What do you need more money for, brother? Black shahada flags aren't expensive. You could make one
yourself.

*26/07/2015, 3:44 pm*

Brother, it has once again been several days since l've heard from you. I really do not
understand why you only get on here once a week. Isn't SurespoI on your phone? It should be easy to
get on here without anyone else seeing.

*27/07/2015, 2:05 pm*

Brother, where are you? I cannot stress how important it is that we remain in regular contact with
each other.

*28/07/2015, 1:22 pm*

Brother, it has been almost a week now. ls your Surespot working? When you donâ€™t answer me, I am
afraid you've been caplured by the kuffar.

*29/07/2015, 2:05 pm*

Akhi I am REALLY trying  to be patient, but it's now been six days since I last heard lrom you. You
promised you would be on here more often, brother.

*30/07/2015, 6:19 pm*

Brother, it has now been a WEEK since Iâ€™ve heard from you. Where are you? I am very worried, akhi.

*31/07/2015, 2:33 pm*

Okay, I am really getting worried now, brother. It has never been this long without a response
before. I am really freaking out. Please tell me you haven't been caught by ASIO.

*01/08/2015, 2:19 pm*

Brother, it has now been NINE DAYS since I have heard from you. I can only assume that either your
Surespot isnâ€™t working or you have been captured by the kuffar.

*02/08/2015, 3:01 am*

Akhi, it has been almost two weeks since I last heard from you. Where are you?

5/08/2015, 4:12 am

Brother, it has now been two weeks since I last heard from you. I am getting seriously convinced
that you have been captured by the kuffar. Please Iet me know that you re okay.

*8/08/2015, 3:35 pm*

Brother, it has now been almost three weeks since I have heard from you. If you were captured by the
kuffar, it would be on the news. So, why are you not responding to me? Is something wrong?

*12/08/2015, 4:07 pm*

Brother, it has now been FOUR WEEKS since Iâ€™ve heard from you I cannot possibly tell you how worried I
am. Are you okay?
*17/08/2015, 2:40 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**

ok akhi, i am sorry I wasnt responding before. I had another brother on twitter randomly message me
and show me a link to 8chan? where you had openly shown screen captures of what I have been saying
and openly telling peope  who i was. Links to my name my twitter, everything

*19/08/2015, 5:00 pm*

i was yery upset and stopped talking to you. my melbourne brother and i have kept quiet as i have
been afraid of the kuffar trying to find where i was because of that.
*19/08/2015, ?*

why did you do that?? i was trying to be security aware and then you started telling people what we were doing??
*19/08/2015, 6:31 pm*

i have to go but i might be back on later, depending on what you say about this. i have kept quiet
and have been worried since nothing has happened, i feel i can start chatting on surespot again

*19/08/2015, 6:34 pm*

speak later, ma assalamah akhi

*19/08/2015, 6:35 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Brother, i am so sorry I made that post when I thought the attack was going to happen in a few
hours. When the attack didn't happen, i tried to delete the thread, but I couldn't. I didnâ€™t link to
your Twitter, I only included a screenshot of our conversations. At the time, I wanted to inspire
other mujahideen. This was during a time when l thought that our attack was imminent and I wanted to
leave a message behind that other mujahideen would see. It was very stupid of me. I should have asked
you first akhi. Again, when I posted that,I thought we were about to attack.

*19/08/2015, 6:42 pm*

I understand if you're mad at me, brother. I only posted that because I wanted to leave a message
behind because I thought our attack was imminent. I will never post anything like that
again
*19/08/2015, 6:45 pm*

I have spent the last several weeks absolutely terrified for you, akhi. I even made a Facebook account
so I could ask other Melbourne brothers if they had heard anything from you. I was
so scared that something had happened to you. You've been the only thing I could think about for
weeks. I was so worried that you had been captured by the kuftar.
*19/08/2015, 6:51 pm*

Please forgive me, akhi. I only made that post because I thought we were going to attack in a few
hours. When you disappeared, I was worried sick. I couldn't get any sleep because I was so worried about you, brother.

*19/08/2015, 6:56 pm*

Brother if it makes you feel any better, the site I posted the thread on is a Tor website. That means
kuffar can't trace anything on it. I also provided some false info in order to confuse any kuffar
who might see the thread.
*19/08/2015, 7:32 pm*

Akhi, I have been talking to an expert mujahid and he says there's no way the kuffar could find
you trom what I posted, especially since it's a Tor site. Would you like to talk to him?

*19/08/2015, 9:45 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
as salamu alaikom, akhi. thank you for your apology, i hope, and inshallah from now on our
conversations stay belween you and me. i see what you mean though about telling other mujahideen to
inspire. but I didnt like how you provided my name and the video that I was in. i told you a while
back not to show anyone. im sure you can understand akhi

*20/08/2015, 4:18 pm*

please just in the future akhi, at least tell me where you are making a post like that, i know you
have helped me out in the past few months and I am grateful, but i am just trying to take your lead
on internet security. if you get what i mean?

*20/08/2015, 4:19 pm*

because i dont know now who will try and talk to me. whether it's a real brother or some type of
kuffar

*20/08/2015, 4:20 pm*

i apologise for causing worry to you, but can u understand why i was afraid??

*20/08/2015, 4:20 pm*

i understand the Tor thing, but they cannot trace YOU, but now kuffar can see me?? as in my
username etc?

*20/08/2015, 4:21 pm*

i just ask allah swt for guidance in my duâ€™a

*20/08/2015, 4:22 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Akhi, I understand. When I posted the screenshot of our conversation, I forgot that your username
showed up in ir. If I had seen your username in the picture, I never would have posted il. I
understand why you were afraid, brother I am so sorry for posting that, and Iâ€™ll never do anything
like that again. I hope you can forgive me, and I hope you are still willing to carry out.
Allah's will with me.

*20/08/2015,  4:22 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
i understand akhi, i know you were only trying to inspire other mujahideen, but i think security of who
i am is more important, until an attack occurs

*20/08/2015, 4:25 pm*

lately, i have been spending majority of my time reading and trying to increase my iman

*20/08/2015, 4:25 pm*

i guess keeping very quiet

*20/08/2015, 4:25 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Did you acquire a black shahada flag, brother?

*20/08/2015, 4:26 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**

no i didn't, i havent really been doing much the last few weeks. i havent even been on twitter
etc. my melbourne brother is still a little worried

*20/08/2015, 4:27 pm*

lol

*20/08/2015, 4:27 pm*

can you still help with this?
*20/08/2015, 4:27 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Absolutely, brother. I will help as much as I can. Just tell me what you need me to do, akhi. I am
totally committed to carrying out the will of Allah (SWT) with you.

*20/08/2015, 4:28 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**

alhamdu lillah

*20/08/2015, 4:29 pm*

i am still keen on doing jihad but after these few weeks, and being quiet, im thinking i should
take a bit more time to understand my iman

*20/08/2015, 4:30 pm*

i guess im a litlle confused

*20/08/2015, 4:31 pm*

**Australi Witness**
What do you mean, akhi?

*20/08/2015, 4:32 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
i just feel alone akhi, my parents wont talk to me, and im keeping everything separate in my real life
*20/08/2015, 4:35 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
I am sorry to hear that akhi. But Allah (SWT) has a plan for us, and what youâ€™re feeling right
now will go away the second we enter Jannah.

*20/08/2015, 4:36 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
i want to carry out the will of allah swt, i know he has plans, i fear his plans but i also want to
embrace them

*20/08/2015, 4:38 pm*

how do u separate who u really are from how you are online? with parents etc, u and i are alike,
parents who are coconuts haha
*20/08/2015, 4:39 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
lt's easy, brother. Just dedicate your life to Allah (SWT) and he will show yov the path. Itâ€™s hard
having parents who are cuconuts, but just don't mention Jihad around them and you should be fine.
Be kind to your parents, and show them love, and they will eventually see the light.

*20/08/2015, 4:42pm*

None of this will matter once we enter Jannah, brother. Allah (SWT) will sort everything out. Just
put your faith in Allah (SWT).

*20/08/2015, 4:44pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
i agree akhi, i am always kind to them, they are pressuring me a lot with making money or leave the
house, i love them but despise them abandoning Islam, i tried putting it down to them being
khawarej but im thinking they are kuffar

*20/08/2015, 4:45 pm*

if you know what i mean

*20/08/2015,4:45pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Brother, if they are threatening to kick you out then we must carry out this attack ASAP Remember,
akhi, when you enter Jannah, you wonâ€™t need any money. The answer to all of our
problems is to carry out jihad and enter Jannah, leaving all of our earthly problems behind
*20/08/2015, 4:47 pm*

I don't want to see you become homeless, akhi. We need to enter Jannah before they kick you out.

*20/08/2015, 4:48pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
thank you for caring brother, i agree, jihad is the only way forward, i can see this and allah swt
has shown me. i just hope this can help brothers over in IS

*20/08/2015, 4:49 pm*

i have to go akhi, i have to catch the train soon and make maghrib, will you be on later??
*20/08/2015, 4:50 pm*

**AustraliWitness**

Yes, I will be on later, akhi. May Allah {SWT) bless you
*20/08/2015, 4:51 pm*

And this attack will definitely help the brothers in IS. We will inspire mujahideen all over the
world, and our names will be known around the world as martyrs for Allah (SWT)

*20/08/2015, 4:52 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
hopefully, inshallah, we can speak more about anything that has changed since i have been offline,
i plan on becoming a shaheed brother, allah swt commands it, we will talk more, Jazaka Allahu
khairan

*20/08/2015, 4:54pm*

                                         Â·
**AustraliWitness**
I am glad to hear it, brother. We can talk whenever you're online. I am totally committed on
becoming a shaheed brother with you, akhi. Itâ€™s all I can think about.

*20/08/2015, 4:55 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
Alhamdu lillah akhi,
*20/08/2015, 4:56pm*

[a](http://assala.mu/)s salamu alaikum akhi, other brothers are speaking to me on surespot. Just letting you know. i
don't really want to tell them what we have been talking about, because I dont know who they are,
could be kuffar. speak later, ma salaam
*21/08/2015, 8:52 am*

**AustraliWitness**
You can talk to wilayahks. He is a trusted mujahid friend of mine.

*21/08/2015, 12:10 pm*

I was thinking, akhi : can you make your video message to the kuffar without a black shahada flag? I
donâ€™t know where to get a black shahada flag, and I don't want you to get caught while
trying to buy one. It doesn't really matter if your video has one, akhi. Your words are the only
thing that matter in the video.

*21/08/2015, 12:11 pm*

Are you there, brother?
*22/08/2015, 3:08 pm*

Akhi, please do not go offline for several days. When you do, I become very worried. Please respond.
23/08/2015, 3:55 pm

Akhi, it's been four days since l've heard from you. Are you okay?

*24/08/2015, 4:19 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
Salaam akhi, you know how I am on this thing, apologiesâ€¦ I started talking to wilayahks but stopped
as i didnt know who anyone was

*25/08/2015, 1:24 pm*

i'm thinking about making my own flag...i know its been very hard actually finding one online, and
then i have to buy it online, maybe too risky??

*25/08/2015, 1:25 pm*

how have you been brother? wilayahks straight out told me that you two were talking about an
â€™operationâ€™ in the states? i didnt really know what to say
*25/08/2015, 1:26 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
If you must have a flag, then you should make your own, brother. But remember : having a flag in
the video isnâ€™t important. Whatâ€™s important is your words, brother.
*25/08/2015, 1:55 pm*

Iâ€™ve been fine, akhi. Regarding wilayahks, he wants to carry out jihad on 9/11, so I sent him same
instructions on how to make pressure cooker bombs, and I found a place for him to target.

*25/08/2015, 1:56 pm*

I want us to carry out our attack before wilayahks carries out his attack, brother. Can you commit to
attacking with me before September starts?

*25/08/2015, 1:56 pm*

But, brother, you HAVE to be on here more often. We cannot plan this if  youâ€™re only one once a week
Please try to get on everyday. If you don't want your parents to see, then just get on when they're
sleeping.

*25/08/2015, 1:58 pm*

                          Â·

Brother, can you commit to this Saturday? We've been preparing this for months. Itâ€™s time for us to
finally strike.

*25/08/2015, 4:07 pm*

Akhi, I've been talking to wilayahks and he says you seem reluctant. Are you really committed to
carrying this out with me, brother? Because it seems like you keep delaying it over and over again.
We can't keep waiting, akhi. If we don't carry this out soon, the kuffar will find us. This jihad is the
answer to all of our problems, brother. When we carry out this attack, we will be martyrs around
the world, and the lslamic State mujahideen will speak of us as heroes. And, once we enter Jannah,
all of our problems will cease to exist. We have nothing to lose, brother. Please - I am begging you,
akhi - please commit to carrying this out with me either this Saturday or next Saturday.

*26/08/2015, 6:20 pm*

Please block greenbirddawlah. They are a kafir reporter posing as a mujahid.

*27/08/2015, 4:02 pm*

Also, brother, you HAVE to carry ouy this attack with me before wilayahks carries out his attack on
9/11. Once wilayahks carries out his attack, the kuffar are going to start seriously trying to track
me down since I gave him instructions. Youâ€™ve had the gun for months, brother. No more excuses. We
carry out the attack either this Saturday or next Saturday.
*27/08/2015, 4:03 pm*

All you have to do is get on Surespot at 9:30 AM on Saturday, tell me youâ€™re ready, and then drive to
the synagogue with your gun and your friend, and go inside and kill as many kuffar as possible.
Then, Iâ€™ll drive down to the Perth synagogue and do the same thing. lt's very simple, brother. You're
making this too complicated.
*27/08/2015, 4:10 pm*

I still have the ricin, but I canâ€™t hold into much longer, akhi.

*27/08/2015, 8:12 pm*

Akhi, it's been four days since l've heard from you. Where are you?

*28/08/2015, 4:05 pm*

Saturday, September 5 at 9Â·30 AM is when we strike, brother. Be ready by then. ll's all been leading
up to this. This is Allah's (SWT) destiny for us, brother. We will be heroes to mujahideen around the
world, and Allah (SWT] will reward us with seals right next to the Prophet (PBUH) in Jannah.

*28/08/2015, 5:00 pm*

Brother, it has now been five days since I've heard from you. I'm sorry, but this is not okay. We have
to remain in constant contact with each other if we're going to carry this out together, akhi.

*29/08/2015, 3:43 pm*

Saturday, September 5 is the date that this HAS to happen on, brother ! We carry out our attack on
September 5 and then, a week later, wilayahks will carry out his attack on September 11.
The kuffar will be paralysed with fear !
*29/08/2015, 3:50 pm*

Brother, it has now been six days since Iâ€™ve heard from you. Is something wrong?
*30/08/2015, 2:14 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
Salaam, akhiâ€¦im sorry about the extended reply. My surespot is always having issues for some reason
when I log in, my messages wont appear but then other times i login my full messages
are there?? so now it i displaying your messages? i use android. have you had the problem akhi?
*31/08/2015, 1:37 pm*

maybe i should be using another app or something?? its really frustrating me akhi

*31/08/2015, 1:38 pm*

im happy to keep using surespot though ,its your call
*31/08/2015, 1:38 pm*

my melbourne brother has been quite difficult with me lately, he keeps saying that we shouldnt be
attacking a synagogue and be more smart about choosing a location so i have been telling him what ur
thoughts are
*31/08/2015, 1:39 pm*

i know it has been a while brother, but as I keep saying, i know you have helped me a lot with
information and targets etc but also want to make my own mark, allah swt willing. I feel the gun
and me alone wonâ€™t be enough
*31/08/2015, 1:40 pm*

im still trying to put together a flag etc bu im also relying on my other brother to get involved

*31/08/2015, 1:42 pm*

wilahyaks spoke to me on here alsoâ€¦ i was a bit nervous to speak to him though because as i said, i
dont know who these people are but if u trust him then thatâ€™s ok

*31/08/2015, 1:42 pm*

green bird dawlah spoke to me to but i think he since deleted me because i stopped replyingg to him
too

*31/08/2015, 1:43 pm*

do u only speak to wilahyaks on here brother??

*31/08/2015, 1:43 pm*

it sounds like you two are putting together quite a plan, is he ready to go akhi??

*31/08/2015, 1:44 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Akhi, if your Surespot is not working properly, then we need to go back to talking on Twitter.

*31/08/2015, 2:00 pm*

Trust me, brother : you alone with a gun would be more than enough. Just look at what happened in
Chattanooga. That was one mujahid with a gun, and he was sjooting at soldiers. Just
imagine how many unarmed Jewish kuffar you could kill.
*31/08/2015, 2:02 pm*

The attack HAS to happen by Saturday, brother. Because wilayahks is going to attack Kansas City on
9/11. Once wilayahks attacks, the kuffar are gonna try harder than ever to track me
down.

*31/08/2015, 2:05 pm*

A synagogue is the perfect place to attack, brother. The Jews are the agents of Shaytan, and they
control all Western governments. An attack on Jews would devastate all kuffar
governments.
*31/08/2015, 2:05 pm*

Think about it, akhi : you attack a synagogue in Melbourne, then I maiI the ricin to politicians, then I attack a synagogue in Perth. It will be the biggest attack in Australian history.
*31/08/2015, 2:07 pm*

Please commit to this attack on Saturday, September 5, brother. We wonâ€™t get a better opportunity
than this.

*31/08/2015, 2:15 pm*

Please, brother - I am begging you - commit to this Saturday. Together, we will carry out the biggest
act of Jihad ever seen in Australia. Then, a few days later, wilayahks will carry out his attack
on Kansas City. We have nothing to lose, akhi. This is Allah's (SWT) destiny for us.
*31/08/2015, 2:39 pm*

Brother, please download kik and add me on there. I m AusWitness.

*31/08/2015, 4:44 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
salaam akhi. again surespot is giving me issuesâ€¦ last night it didnt let me input my password also. iâ€™ll
try kik. is that a secure app or a normal chat app?? Ill download it now and have a look. jazaka allahu
khairan
*1/09/2015, 9:45 am*

i sent you a message akhi, but idont know if i like kikâ€¦ surespot seems to be working ok, inshallah

*1/09/2015, 10:12 am*

**AustraliWitness**
Well, akhi. I need to make sure you receive my messages on time, and Surespot seems to be messing
up for you. Did you enable push notifications on kik so you get notified every time I
message you? If not, please do. We have to remain in constant contact, brother.
*1/09/2015, 4:12 pm*

Please check your kik messages, brother. kik is secure.

*1/09/2015, 4:13 pm*

You gotta commit this Saturday, akhi. This is our last chance. Make your video now, and forget
about the black shahada flag, brother.
*1/09/2015, 4:44 pm*

Allah (SWT) has given us this perfect opportunity. If we take it, we will be rewarded with seats right
next to the Prophet (PBUH) in Jannah.
*1/09/2015, 4:45 pm*

No more excuses, akhi. This is Allah's will. Allah's will does not seek excuses.
*1/09/2015, 4:53 pm*

Brother, I know you read my messages. I can see you did. Please respond.

*1/09/2015, 9:17 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
salaam akhi, you need to relax and stop putting so much pressure on me. i did see your kik
messages, i dont like kik so im not using itâ€¦ surespot is more secure so im going to try and use
this instead â€¦ this is my life akhi, i will make up the time to commit my jihad and the pressure ur
putting on me is not healthy

*2/09/2015, 9:01 am*

i know I have the gun, i know I can commit the attack but it needs to be the right time for me
akhi,

*2/09/2015, 9:02 am*

are you even ready to do this? i never really liked the option of my attacking first then you
attacking and mailing ricin, i didnt understand it now because wilyahks is going to attack. ur
putting more pressure on me

*2/09/2015, 09:03 am*

im trying to do the right things by my parents and pay my dues, the filthy kuffar will have there
day, but it needs to be on my time akhi

*2/09/2015, 9:03 am*

I suppose thats also why i have been delaying with messages. i dont feel like ur listening to me,
and Just wanting me to do it now ! im not doing it nowâ€¦ i will let you know, im sorry, i know u will
be disappointed. but I also want to do things my way. with the video and sending the message to the
west of what they have done to muslims around the worldâ€¦ youe agenda seems different to mine
*2/09/2015, 9:04 am*

i have earnt quite a bit of money in the last few months from work, so I am even thinking of making
my zakat to benifet the brothers over in IS, or a muslim that really needs itâ€¦

*2/09/2015, 9:16 am*

**AustraliWitness**

Akhi, my Surespot keeps crashing, so I sent you a message on Facebook Please check your Facebook
messages.

*2/09/2015, 11:15 pm*

The message is very important Please read it.

3*/09/2015, 1:14 am*

Brother, I cannot make this any clearer : if we do not attack VERY soon, we will get caught. Please
check your Facebook messages, as I sent you some responses.
3*/09/2015, 5:31 pm*

Akhi, other mujahideen are starting to think that Iâ€™m a fake and that I just made you up. Your refusal
to carry out this attack with me is making me look like a liar.

*4/09/2015, 8:11 pm*

Jzk for the response, akhi. Check your Facebook messages, as I responded again. September 13 is the
day wilayahks attacks, and itâ€™s also the day that the Jewish kuffar are holding Erev Rosh Hashanah
services. The synagogues wiII be very crowded. lt's the perfect time to attack.    

4*/09/2015,11:25 pm*                '

Akhi, I have great news. JihadiUK says he can send you a black shahada flag through parcel, but only
if you committ to this September 13. His username is Jihadi on Surespot. He is a very
trusted mujahid.
*5/09/2015, 2:15 am*

Please add him, brother. He can send you a black shahada flag which should arrive in a few days. His
current Surespot name is Jihadi.

*5/09/2015, 3:09 am*

Akhi,please accept Jihadiâ€™s invite. He can send you a black shahada flag which can arrive before
Septembe, 13/

*5/09/2015, 5:15 pm*

Brother, are you receiving my messages On Surespot?
*6/09/2015, 11:32 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**
brother, is your surespot all good now? mine seems to be good, i got your messages on facebook. that
kehilat nitzan sounds like a good target akhi

*7/09/2015, 3:05 pm*

i should be ready, inshallah im speaking with jihad on here to try and get the flag so i record
something

*7/09/2015, 3:05 pm*

this will be glorious akhi, im excited that you have now organised it with a brother over in the
usa. this was the kind of impact I was looking for, may Allah swt reward you when you enter Jannah

*7/09/2015, 3:05 pm*

Is wilyahks also attacking a jewish synagogue??

*7/09/2015, 3:07 pm*

i hope, inshallah, i can get the flag, imagine I had that when we strike, what a message this will
show to the filthy kuffar.

*7/09/2015, 3:08 pm*

the news slory will be huge and brothers over in IS will be very thankful
*7/09/2015, 3:09 pm*

you have worked hard akhi, it is time for us to bring down the west in their own land!alhamdulilla!
*7/09/2015, 3:09 pm*

ma salaam, Iâ€™ll be back in a little bit, take care akhi

*7/09/2015, 3:10 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Yes, brother, my Surespot seems to be working now.

*7/09/2015, 3:47 am*

I hope you can get the flag on time, but itâ€™s okay if you canâ€™t. He might not be able to mail the
flag to you in just a few days since I don't think he lives in Australia. Are you still making your
own flag, brother?

*7/09/2015, 3:48 pm*

lndeed, brother. I am so excited that we are finally going to carry this out. We wiII be legendary
shaheeds, and the lslamic State mujahideen will honour us as iconic martyrs.

*7/09/2015, 3:49 pm*

wilayahks is attacking a firefighter event. US time is about a day behind Austraha time, so we'II
attack the synagogues in Austraia a little bit  before he attacks Kansas City.

*7/09/2015, 3:50 pm*

I canâ€™t wait for us to enter Jannah together, akhi. This is what weâ€™ve been preparing for our entire lives.  Allah (SWT) will reward us with seats right next to the Prophet (PBUH) in Jannah.

*7/09/2015, 3:51pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**

excellent akhi, mine was bring buggy but i think itâ€™s all good now! inshallah yeah jihad said he was in the UK so it might take a few days to some, ill respond to him now, but i was trying to get a smaller shahada flag if i cant get it in time then as you said, my words and actions will speak for them self!!

*8/09/2015, 1:05 pm*

yes akhi, i agreeâ€¦ the time is coming where we will enter Jannah as shaheeds. i hope we inspire other brothers in australia to actâ€¦  

*8/09/2015, 1:06 pm*

ok ahhi, why fire fighter? was that his decision? based on the 9/11 rescuers or something?

*8/09/2015, 1:06 pm*

is there anything else i should know before hand brother? how will u get to the perth shule? i dont
have a car anymore but i will work something out, inshallah, everything will go to plan and we can
carry out allahâ€™s will together, alhamdulillah!!

*8/09/2015, 1:11 am*

**AustraliWitness**
lndeed, brother. lt's great if you can get a flag, but don't worry too much about. Remember :
getting a flag is the least important part. The most important part is killing the maximum
number of kuffar.

*8/09/2015, 3:27 pm*

We will inspire brothers all over the world to act, akhi. We wiII be the spark that ignites a
revolution.

*8/09/2015, 3:28 pm*

The firefighter thing is a 9/11 remembrance event held on September 13.

*8/09/2015, 3:28 pm*

I can drive to the Perth shule, brother. Are you sure youâ€™ll be able to get to the Melbourne
synagogue I showed you on September 13 at 6 PM? Make sure you have a way to get there on
time, brother .

*8/09/2015, 3:29 pm*

Akhi, Jihadi says it's too late for him to mail you the flag. But that's not important, brother. We
donâ€™t need any flags. Our actions will speak louder than any flag, inshaallah. 

*8/09/2015, 3:54 pm*

**AFP Federal Agent**

Ok akhi, i will get there. I will just borrow my mums car or something. i will sort it out, inshallah

*9/09/2015, 10:58 am*

I will get there on time akhi, i will make sure of it. It is Allah's swt will
9*/09/2015, 10:59 am*

I cant wait to cut down these filthy kuffar. I will even film it on my phone akhi

9*/09/2015,  11:00 am*

I thought that jihad may not be able to get it to me but was worth a try. Have you made sure your
gun is still working ok and ready to go?

9*/09/2015,  11:01 am*

**AustraliWitness**
My gun is working great, akhi. I cannot wait for this. We will be true lions, tearing the filthy
kuffar apart.

*10/09/2015, 3:21 am*

Akhi, make sure to ask Jihadi for advice on how to kill the most kuffar. He helped me plan it out. He
can help you too.

*10/09/2015, 3:22 am*

**AFP Federal Agent**
Salaam, you were up early akhi! whats the time difference in Perth?? yes brother, only a few more
days until we strike at their hearts! Allahu Akbar!!

*10/09/2015, 3:32 pm*

yah akhi, thank you i will reach out to jihad for more advice, but i think, inshallah, we are ready
and we can fulfil this for allah swt.

*10/09/2015, 3:33 pm*

on a side note, i should be able to take my mothers car without her knowing too, Alhamdulillah!!

*10/09/2015, 3:34 pm*

**AustraliWitness**

I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a big time difference, akhi. You know exactly where the synagogue is, right?

*10/09/2015, (9:05 pm?)*

Akhi, where are you? lt has been more than five days since l've heard from you, brother. I need you to
get on Surespot and respond to my messages. lt's very urgent.

Brother, please download kik and add me on there. l'm AusWitness .

My Surespot is not working at the moment, so l'm going to have to send you this message here.
Brother, do you have any idea how much hard work l've done preparing this attack? Do you have any
idea how long l've waited for you, how patient l've been, and how long l've been ready? I have been
ready for months, and l've done everything I can to help you get ready too. No other mujahid would
have been as patient as I have been. Every time I speak to a mujahid about you, they tell me that I
should just stop trying, and they tell me that you're never going to attack with me. But I refuse to give
up, because I trust you, brother. You promised me months ago that you would participate in this
attack with me, and a true Muslim doesn't tell false promises. You say that you're waiting for the right
time, but, brother, this IS the right time. You're not going to get a better time than this. Allah (SWT)
given you the perfect opportunity, yet you refuse to take it. Brother, how many more times are you
going to delay this? At this point, l'm starting to feel betrayed by you. I feel like you're never going to
attack with me, even though you promised me you would. And now I hear that you're planning to
donate money to brothers in the Islamic State? Akhi, are you TRYING to get caught? Sending money
from Australia to brothers in the dawlah GUARANTEES that the kuffar will capture you. If you want to
inspire brothers in the lslamic State, then you need to carry out this attack with me. THAT is how you
help the lslamic State, akhi. But, instead, you just keep making excuses for why you refuse to carry
out Allah's will. l'm getting tired of your excuses, brother. l'm starting to agree with what the other
mujahideen have told me: I don't think you're ever going to carry out this attack with me. l'm just so
disappointed, brother. I really thought you were a true shaheed.

salaam akhi, maybe itâ€™s a surespot bug going around lol.
akhi, trust me i know how much you're committed to this and i know you have put a lot into speaking to
me about it, i am still going to attack, however my melbourne brother has been in my ear about
certain things, and he has suggested making a bigger mark, other than guns ... maybe even
something that will cause more destruction, i dont know.
i know you have been ready for months akhi, the thing is, why arent you going to do this by yourself if
committing jihad asap is key for you??
i never said i wasnt going to do it. all i said akhi, was that i have progressed a little in my planning and
coordination with my melbourne brother, keeping it local and maximising the attack here in
melbourne.
Other mujahids will say what they want to benifet themselves, we are all united here but please akhi,
just know that im not dismissing everything you have done, i am just taking time to make sure i am
doing jihad my way, i hate the kuffar and they need to pay. especially for brainwashing my parents, to
which they have shown no remorse for.
i appreciate that you trust me akhi, i trust you too, i just think we are on slightly different pages at the
moment. i need to commit jihad in my own time brother,
what can i do to prove my faith and trust to you? to restore your trust?? tell me akhi?? can i send you
some money instead? instead of over to IS?
im not delaying and telling you false promises, as i said akhi, in my own time, allah swt has a will for
me and me only. i will die a shaheed!!!

Akhi, your Melbourne brother is going to get you caught. He has no idea what he's talking about. The
longer you delay this attack and the more people you get involved, the more likely you are to get
caught. Lone wolf attacks with guns are the most effective kind of attack for striking terror into the
hearts of the kuffar. You need to forget about this idea of pulling off some "bigger" attack. Brother, we
cannot pull off a 9/11-caliber attack in Australia. We do not have the time or resources for that. What
we CAN do is carry out the biggest attack in Australian history if we both attack on the same day. The
attack is already going to be huge if you just agree to carry it out. Trying to make it even "bigger" will
only get us caught. Akhi, I really think you need to forget about bringing your Melbourne brother along
for this. He can become a shaheed some other way, akhi. But, right now, he's only going to delay this
attack even further.
On September 13 is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. lf you're not willing to attack by then, then I
don't think you're ever going to attack. Yom Kippur is the absolute best possible time to attack the
kuffar. The synagogue will be more crowded than ever. Remember, brother: the Jews are the ones
who brainwashed your parents. The Jews are the ones who control the kuffar government and the
kuffar media. The Jews are the ones who slaughter innocent Muslims around the world. The Jews
killed the Rasul (SAW). So, if we truly love the Prophet (PBUH), then we are obligated to carry out
jihad against Jews.

You say you want to commit the attack on "your own time", but when is "your own time", brother?
When? When are you ever going to be ready? lt doesn't seem like you ever are. Allah's will for you is
to carry out this attack, and you are making excuses for why you refuse to carry out Allah's will. Allah's
will does not accept excuses, brother.
On September 11, wilayahks will carry out his attack in Kansas City. Once wilayahks carries out his
attack, the kuffar are going to try harder than ever to track me down - and they might actually manage
to capture me. And, if the kuffar capture me, they will also capture my friends. If we don't enter
Jannah within the next few days, we will get caught, akhi. Do you want us to get captured by the
kuffar and tortured for information, brother? Or do you want to enter Jannah? The choice is yours.
Please, akhi - please carry out this attack with me. You have had months and months to get ready. I
have been as patient as I can possibly be. No more excuses, brother. lt's time for us to become
shaheeds and carry out Allah's will together. If you do this with me, your name will become legendary,
and the kuffar will feel terror in their hearts just from the mere mention of your name. You will become
a heroic martyr for mujahideen around the world. But, if you keep delaying this, you wi ll be just
another mujahid who got caught before he could attack. Make your decision soon, brother. There isn't
much time left.

Sorry, I meant September 22. Yom Kippur is on September 22. But the kuffar might capture me
before then.

*03,09/2015 13:42*
**Australi Witness**
Also, you should know that Surespot is no longer safe, and the kuffar can track us through it, so
please use kik instead: http [//justpaste.it/surespot](https://justpaste.it/surespot)

**Bismillahi Rahmaani Raheem Surespot has been compromise**... â€¢ [justpaste.it](http://justpaste.it/)

I was chatting on surespot until a very old conversation came up again which i have deleted a long time ago. l
asked the other user if he deleted the old conversation and he confirmed. Our recent messages where
somewhere in between the old conversations so we had to search for it. So we both deleted ...

Maybe youâ€™re right akhi, I don't know. He has been such a good brother to me in the past but I am
sick of waiting for him also. He's just wanting to do something separate from guns, something that will
cause much more destruction, but I don't know, inshallah we can work this out together, he is a good
Muslim.
i agree akhi, as u know, i have always wanted to stick to the gun idea, i mean, i have the gun and i
want to use it, i want to show the kuffar that they are not untouchable, and that Islam will soon rule the
world. Brothers over in IS would love this wouldn't they??
I'Il google yom kippur, plenty of jews akhi?? What type of celebration is it? Security guiards etc?? lm
starting to think that maybe we should act and that maybe this festival would be an idea. Iâ€™ll have a
good look akhi, I promise. Maybe I can even influence my brother. ..
Do you and wilayahks have a location picked out? Cant you include me a bit more in whats going on
there? If our attack would be related to what he is doing then I should know more akhi??
Kuffar cannot capture you brother, you have been too smart with ur internet security. Tor and what
not. How couId they even get through that?? Do not be paranoid brother, I had a right to be paranoid
when you leaked my twitter on 8chan but I am still here, do not worry. Allah swt is protecting us.
Jzk for your worry akhi, I know you have been there with me for months, let me try and sort out with
my Melbourne brolher and iâ€™ll keep u updated. If he's going to take forever, then im more inclined to
follow you.
At the end of the day, kuffar will pay, our plans will spark fear into ail of their hearts. No one can be
safe here. I feel that allah swt has guided me properly. Ma salamah akhi, may allah swt bless you and
reward you for your intentions. Alhamdulillah .

Jzk for your response, akhi. Your Melbourne brother might be a good brother, but it sounds tome like
he doesn't really want to attack. If we pull off this attack together, it will already be the largest attack in
Australian history. We can't obsess over carrying out something "bigger'', because we don't have the
resources to do that. We can't carry out something like 9/11, akhi. That's not possible for us. But, with
our guns and my ricin, we can still carry out a massive attack that will strike fear into the hearts of
kuffar around the world, Allah (SWT) willing. Â·
Take a look at the synagogue schedule, akhi: httpJ/www kehHatnitzan org aufworship html
There are lots of big events coming up that we could target.
Wilayahks and I have picked out our location. Turns out it's actually going to be on September 13.
Akhi, do you think you couId agree to carry out the attack on September 13? lt would be perfect. We
carry out our attack in Australia, then wilayahks carries out his attack in Kansas City.
Looking at the schedule, it would appear that there is a targe Erev Rosh Hashanah service on
September 13. We should target that, akhi. This is the absolute perfect time to target. We can't keep
waiting, brother. We need to carry out Allah'swill.
September 13 at 6 PM at Kehilat Nitzan, akhi. Can you commit to this? I already have a local
synagogue to target in Perth too.
We attack Australia, then wilayahks attacks Kansas City. We will be legendary martyrs.

Akhi, JihadiUK says he can send you a black shahada flag through parcel, but only if you commit to
carry out this attack on September 13. He's added you on Surespot. His username is Jihadi. Please
accept his invite, akhi. He is a very trusted mujahid, and he can help us carry this out to maximum
effect.

**AFP Federal Agent**
Salaam akhi, shukran for the messages and for seeking help from jihadUK, may Allah swt reward
you.
Yah akhi, i understand that we cant do a 911 style attack but i always beleived it could be bigger.
Especially with my melbourne brother by my side to slay as many filthy kuffar as possible. lm still
trying to get him on board, but inshallah he will see Allah swt will soon.
I will have a look at that synagogue. Is it september 13 or 22? I think you originally corrected yourself
and said 22? Iâ€™ll confirm online anway.
Thats good he has a location in kansas city akhi. Is he set and ready to go? Wasnt he making a
bomb??
What synagogue in Perth are you looking at akhi? Have you made sure no security etc? September
13 sounds like a plan akhi. Especially when it is coordinated with a usa mujahid brother.
Jihaduk did message me and i accepted him on surespot. Ill talk to him tonight. We should start
talking back on there. Mine seems to be working ok now. Ma salamah akhi, talk later.

**Australi Witness**
lt's on September 13, akhi. This is different from what I was telling you about before. This is Erev
Rosh Hashanah, which cornes before Yom Kippur. lt will be very crowded, and there will be tons of
Jewish kuffar to kill. The services at the Melbourne synagogue I showed you start on September 13 at
6 PM. Remember that, akhi. The address is 36-40 Hawthorn Road, Caulfield North. Here it is on a
map: http://www.[street-directory.com](http://street-directory.com/) au/sd_new/mapsearch.cgi?star=5&5&&x=145.025205&y=-

%2038%20Hawthorn%20Rd, %20Caulfield%20North%20VIC%203161
This is the synagogue I will be targeting in Perth, akhi. I already checked. and it's very crowded:
[http://www](http://www/)theperthshule.[asn.au/](http://asn.au/) 
I am so glad you've finally agreed to carry this out with me, brother. We are going to become
legendary shaheeds, Allah (SWT) willing. We will be rewarded with seats right next to the Prophet
(PBUH) in Jannah.
Remember, brother: from now on, you have to get on Surespot every day. We don't have much time
left. We have to carry this out on September 13.
