If there’s one thing that I’ll never understand, it’s the desire to suppress speech instead of allowing it to be aired and judged for itself in the great American [marketplace of ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace_of_ideas); Censors typically censor speech because they fear what is being said.

If a writer whom I despised wrote an article foaming at the mouth about how all Jews should be exterminated, the *last…* thing that I’d want to do would be to censor that writer.  To the contrary, in fact – I would spread the article far and wide and encourage the writer to put out more articles just like it.

Americans who strongly believe in anti-racism, gay rights, and feminism will defend the right to advocate violence against blacks, gays, and women.  Black Americans will defend the right of KKK members to burn crosses and call for the lynching of blacks.

People are not braindead, glassy-eyed automatons who mindlessly accept absolutely everything that they read or hear without even thinking about it. People respond positively to well-thought-out, persuasive, and reasonable arguments. Why encourage people that you hate to express views that you loathe in a civil and reasonable way rather than in a crass and despicable way?

If you want to defeat someone’s speech, defeat it with speech of your own.  Attempting to forcibly silence it only demonstrates to the public that you *can’t* defeat it and are thus trying to prevent people from hearing it lest they be convinced by it.  Censorship always helps the censored, and it’s about time for people to learn that.  Censorship is perfectly unnatural.

**In 2014, Swedish police charged the controversial artist Dan Park with “hate speech” and “defamation” for Park’s satirical artworks, which allegedly depicted blacks and gypsies in a “racist” manner.**

Just a few days later, Europeans were marching in solidarity with satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, proclaiming their undying support for freedom of speech after the magazine’s offices were attacked by jihadists over its caricatures of Muhammed. What’s the difference? The difference is that Charlie Hebdo was considered to be acceptable by the governments of Europe, whereas Dan Park’s artwork was not.
