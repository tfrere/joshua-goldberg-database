### 20/07/2011, 11:37 pm : ***Speech Delay At A Young Age?***

**MoonMetropolis wrote :**

*I have not been officially diagnosed with aspergers, but a psychologist told me that people with autism typically have speech delays at a young age. I never had speech delays. Quite the opposite, in fact. I was very much ahead in terms of speech. Does this mean that I for sure am not an aspie? I had plenty of other aspie-like behaviors, though, such as tactile issues. And, in addition, I display every other symptom of aspergers in the extreme.*

*Does anyone else take online courses? I took them from the middle of 5th grade to the middle of 9th grade, when I started going to a public school. I went to that worthless school for half a year and for the first few weeks of the next year, before I started doing online school again. I have decided that online work is the best option for me, since it allows me to focus on my work without having to deal with America's failing public school system, America's failing public school teachers, and America's failing public school students. Although, as always, my ADHD does admittedly get in the way of accomplishing work.*

*Does anyone else have any experiences with online school?*

### **09/08/2011, 12:37 am :**

*It would be impossible for me to adequately summarize the sheer, overpowering amount of hatred and contempt I have for my generation (teenagers and "young adults"). While it's true that I do hate humans in general, I have a special hatred for 99.9% of teenagers and such.* (…)

*This is the Internet generation, after all. People view graphic videos of rapes and murders every day, giggle at them, and then pass them along to their friends. Any sense of dignity or humanity we once had has long since been completely eradicated. As the Internet has shown us, we are nothing but savage and depraved animals. People reveal things about themselves on the Internet that they wouldn't even dream of revealing to anyone in real life - not even to a therapist. When people are anonymous and they don't have to accept responsibility for their actions, they will simply do as they please. This is why the Internet is such a portal into the darkest depths of human degeneracy. It completely depersonalizes us and allows us to view other people as nothing more than objects. Ultimately, it will be the downfall of our civilization. The thought of these sex-obsessed, hedonistic, chauvinistic, solipsistic, materialistic, superficial, brutish, uneducated troglodytes one day attempting to run the world is beyond terrifying. It makes me scared for the future of mankind. I mean, how do these idiots even dress themselves? All they know is violence, debasing sex, drugs, petty crime, fast food, mindless debauchery, and MTV. That is our culture.*

*And no, I am not going to "shoot up schools" or kill anyone, so don't even start with that crap. Seriously.*

*I love how the media sensationalizes bullying and acts like it's some new teen trend. Bullying has always been around and it always will be around.*

*Teenagers are cruel, petty, ignorant pieces of s**t. In fact, many adults are too.*

*This generation is absolutely vile and disgusting. But perhaps we should focus less on this "cyberbullying" nonsense and focus more on people who are ACTUALLY being beaten bloody and abused by REAL bullies, not just stupid online gossiping and name-calling. Just a thought.*

*I mean, really. If you are going to kill yourself because someone said a few mean things about you online, then clearly something was wrong with you to begin with and you obviously were completely sheltered and unprepared for life in the real world. That's really the epitome of over-sensitive.*

*How could anyone possibly handle reality when they can't even handle some mean people online?*

*This is going to sound awful, but bullying actually helps some people in a way. Those of us who are tough enough to take it without committing suicide often end up stronger for it. Sometimes, we develop paranoid social disorders, but who's to say I wouldn't be this way anyway?*

*Plus, most bullies grow up to be failures, and we survivors look forward to the day when we see our former enemies on the street begging for change.*

*And, when they stop us and ask for help, we'll just stand there laughing at them as they pick up the handful of pennies we threw at their feet. It is always truly delightful to watch your enemies crumble.*

*My point? The media will exploit anything to make a quick buck. The media is the ultimate bully.*

*I could act "normal" if I wanted to, but why should I change myself to seek the approval of others? Hell, I don't even WANT the approval of others.*

*I used to act like a total clown and flaunt my intelligence because, I suppose, I simply didn't know how to act. I would sing and dance and generally make a buffoon of myself so people would think I was cool. Looking back, it simply makes me cringe.*

*Nowadays, I am very cold and distant, especially with strangers. The more respect I have for someone, the less likely I am to talk to them. This is because I know I'll say something wrong and ruin it -- or perhaps they'll say something wrong, and I'll lose respect for them. I have been told many, many times that I lack basic social skills. But, the thing is, I really couldn't care less.*
