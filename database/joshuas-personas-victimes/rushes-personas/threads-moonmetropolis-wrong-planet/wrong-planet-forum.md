****Are You Able To Hide Your Aspergers?****

[https://wrongplanet.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=185888&p=4300523#p4300523](https://wrongplanet.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=185888&p=4300523#p4300523)

Do people notice there's something "odd" about you? Are you able to conceal your aspie-ness? And, most importantly, do you care?

I could act "normal" if I wanted to, but why should I change myself to seek the approval of others? Hell, I don't even WANT the approval of others.

I used to act like a total clown and flaunt my intelligence because, I suppose, I simply didn't know how to act. I would sing and dance and generally make a buffoon of myself so people would think I was cool. Looking back, it simply makes me cringe.

Nowadays, I am very cold and distant, especially with strangers. The more respect I have for someone, the less likely I am to talk to them. This is because I know I'll say something wrong and ruin it -- or perhaps they'll say something wrong, and I'll lose respect for them. I have been told many, many times that I lack basic social skills. But, the thing is, I really couldn't care less.
