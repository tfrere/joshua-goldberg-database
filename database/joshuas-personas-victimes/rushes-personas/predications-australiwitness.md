THE VIRTUES OF JIHAD AND MUJAHIDEEN

‘Allah says: So let those fight in the cause of Allah who sells the life of this world

for the Hereafter. And he who fights in the cause of Allah and is killed or

achieves victory — We will bestow upon him a great reward.’

Allah reserved one hundred levels in Paradise for the Mujahideen, between

each level and the other is the distance between the heavens and earth.

The Messenger of Allah was asked, “What is the best of all acts of worship?” He said,

“Believing in Allah” He was asked, “And then what?” He responded, “Jihad in the path of

Allah”.

The Messenger of Allah was asked, “Who is the best of people?” He said, “A believer who

is making jihad with his life and his wealth in the cause of Allah. ”

*Jihad is the best deed after Salah and being dutiful towards one’s Parents :*

*Jihad is the greatest deed after believing in Allah.*

*Jihad is the most beloved deed to Allah.*

*The Mujahid is the greatest of all people.*

THE VIRTUES OF KILLING A NON-BELIEVER FOR THE SAKE OF ALLAH

“...So when you meet those who disbelieve in battle, strike their necks...”

The Messenger of Allah said: “The nonbeliever and the one who kills him will never be joined

together in Hellfire ”

Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not

consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who

do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the

Scripture - fight until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled.
