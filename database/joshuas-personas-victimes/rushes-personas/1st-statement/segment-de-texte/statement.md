# Statement

The Joshua Goldberg who wrote for Thought Catalog was a persona as well. Everything that I do online and offline is a persona. Virtually all of my words and actions are just me taking on roles or putting on an act. I have no real idea of who I “really” am and what my “real” personality is. And I can analyze fictional characters, but I can’t analyze myself, so I suppose that I sort of have to turn myself into a fictional character in order for things to make sense to me. I have no real sense of self or any real self-identity. I have no idea what I “really” am. I can’t just “be myself”, because I have no idea who “myself” really is.

Creating personas is not just something that I do on the internet. A few times when I was [In medical center] , I told people that I was Apollo, a computer hacker from Hagatna, Guam. If I had been living on a college campus, I probably would have gone as far as dressing up like a woman, putting on a voice modifier, and passing myself off as Ponette LaCroix, an exchange student from Paris. 

Perhaps, at the end of the day, that’s all that I really am: a persona factory. Is that really something that anyone should aspire to be? No, of course not. I am little more than a hollow shell of a person, able to put on an act and pretend to be whoever I want, but not able to have any real sense of who I truly am. So, as my old online self-description goes: Who am I? Well, that sure beats me.
