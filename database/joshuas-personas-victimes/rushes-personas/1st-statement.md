Le Joshua Goldberg qui a écrit pour Thought Catalog était également une personne fictive. Tout ce que je fais, en ligne et hors ligne, est une personne fictive. Presque tous mes mots et mes actions, sur Internet et dans la vie réelle, ne sont que des rôles que j'adopte ou des actes que je joue. Je n'ai aucune idée réelle de qui je suis "vraiment" et quelle est ma personnalité "réelle". Et je peux analyser des personnages fictifs, mais je ne peux pas m'analyser moi-même, donc je suppose que je dois me transformer en un personnage fictif (ou plusieurs personnages fictifs) pour que les choses aient un sens pour moi. Je n'ai pas de véritable sens de soi ou d'identité réelle. Je n'ai aucune idée de ce que je suis "vraiment". Je ne peux pas simplement "être moi-même", car je ne sais pas qui est "moi-même" vraiment.

Créer des personnages fictifs n'est pas seulement quelque chose que je fais sur Internet. Quelques fois, quand j'étais à Butner FMC, j'ai dit aux gens que j'étais Apollo, un pirate informatique de Hagatna, Guam. Si j'avais vécu sur un campus universitaire, j'aurais probablement été aussi loin que de me déguiser en femme, de mettre un modificateur de voix et de me faire passer pour Ponette LaCroix, une étudiante en échange de Paris. Ensuite, j'aurais probablement changé de tenue et de perruque, ajusté mon modificateur de voix et dit aux gens que j'étais Pandora Baskova, une peintre russo-américaine d'Anchorage, Alaska.

Peut-être qu'à la fin de la journée, c'est tout ce que je suis vraiment : une usine de personnages fictifs. Est-ce vraiment quelque chose à quoi quiconque devrait aspirer ? Non, bien sûr que non. Tout comme Roger, je ne suis rien de plus qu'une coquille vide - capable de jouer un rôle et de prétendre être qui je veux, mais incapable d'avoir une réelle compréhension de qui je suis vraiment. Alors, comme le disait ma vieille description en ligne de moi-même : Qui suis-je? Eh bien, ça me dépasse.

- **ORIGINAL**
    
    The Joshua Goldberg who wrote for Thought Catalog was a persona as well. Everything that I do — both online and offline — is a persona. Virtually all of my words and actions — on the internet and in real life — are just me taking on roles or putting on an act. I have no real idea of who I “really” am and what my “real” personality is. And I can analyze fictional characters, but I can’t analyze myself, so I suppose that I sort of have to turn myself into a fictional character (or numerous fictional characters) in order for things to make sense to me. I have no real sense of self or any real self-identity. I have no idea what I “really” am. I can’t just “be myself”, because I have no idea who “myself” really is.
    
    Creating personas is not just something that I do on the internet. A few times when I was at Butner FMC, I told people that I was Apollo, a computer hacker from Hagatna, Guam. If I had been living on a college campus, I probably would have gone as far as dressing up like a woman, putting on a voice modifier, and passing myself off as Ponette LaCroix, an exchange student from Paris. Then I probably would have changed my outfit and wig, adjusted my voice modifier, and told people that I was Pandora Baskova, a Russian-American painter from Anchorage, Alaska.
    
    Perhaps, at the end of the day, that’s all that I really am: a persona factory. Is that really something that anyone should aspire to be? No, of course not. Much like Roger, I am little more than a hollow shell of a person — able to put on an act and pretend to be whoever I want, but not able to have any real sense of who I truly am. So, as my old online self-description goes: Who am I? Well, that sure beats me.

- **Trolling is a black mark of shame : Regrets and Excuses**
    
    ADDENDUM: It dawned on me after I wrote this article that, in all of my snide, sardonic, saturnine snickering and snarking, I, at times, come across like a pompous, arrogant, unctuous jackass with absolutely no self-awareness whatsoever who proudly wears the “KING OF TROLLS” title as some kind of badge of honor. As such, I would like to make this explicitly clear: there is absolutely no justification for any of the senseless, destructive, and antisocial activities that I was engaging in online. Andrew Anglin himself described me as “the most prolific troll to date”, but rest assured that I do not take any pride whatsoever in that. To the contrary, it’s a black mark of shame that will dog me for the rest of my life, and it’s something that I hope I will be able to move past in the coming years. Even if I never really intended for anyone to actually get hurt as a result of my online mischief, the simple fact of the matter is that my profoundly foolish and reckless online actions very well could have resulted in serious damage being done to real people, and it is very fortunate that I was arrested before my online shitposting inadvertently spilled over into real life. While it goes without saying that I will never apologize to any of the people talked about in this particular article (and I will certainly never apologize to the Australian government either), I do offer my sincerest apologies to the organizers of the Kansas City Stairclimb, who I caused a great deal of emotional distress to with the bogus jihadist plot that lead to my arrest (much more about that phony terror plot in the public statement that I previously published), and I also offer my sincerest apologies to any other innocent people who I caused mental turmoil to with my incredibly stupid, vile, obnoxious, and, at times, even downright monstrous online actions. If you are someone who I have hurt in the past — and you’re not rancid, scrofulous, scum-sucking subhuman plankton like Andrew Anglin — then I am truly sorry, and I earnestly hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Most people on the autism spectrum tend to use their autism as an unlimited “get away with everything free” card, but not me. I accept full responsibility for my actions, and having autism provides absolutely no excuse for anything that I did. Thankfully, my thoughtless and fatuous actions in cyberspace never actually resulted in anyone getting tangibly hurt in real life, but they very well could have. Completely engulfed in the extremely negative and deleterious world of internet trolling, I showed absolutely no concern for how starting random online arson fires might actually result in real people getting hurt for real, and many of my online actions paint me as, as Anglin put it, “an unhinged psychopath”. That isn’t who I really am, and that certainly isn’t something that I take pride in — quite the opposite, in fact. As such, I just want to make that as crystal clear as I possibly can.
    

- **I’m not sorry to anyone I trolled, but I am for my family**
    
    Am I sorry for the puerile trolling that I carried out on sites like Reddit and Twitter? In all honesty, no. But, if there is anyone who I am eternally sorry to, it’s my family, whose name I have forever besmirched. They are the only ones (besides me, of course) who were truly hurt by my actions. The amount of stress that I put on my family was overwhelming. My mother already has multiple sclerosis and a myriad of other problems to deal with, so the last thing that she needed was for her son (and, by extension, her) to be thrust into the middle of a high-profile terrorism trial and accompanying international media frenzy. When I was first arrested, I truly feared that my mother would end up in the hospital, if not the morgue.

</aside>

- **Je suis très obstiné about freedom of speech bc I want limits placed on power + pro-choixe +  anti-death penalty**
    
    People would often tell me that I was quite vagarious and mercurial in which political viewpoints I espoused. Indeed, I often capriciously espoused an extremely eclectic array of wildly incompatible ideological viewpoints — ranging from far-left to far-right — basically just going out of my way to always be as iconoclastic and contrarian as possible and to always disagree with whoever I was arguing with at the moment. With that said, I have always been very obdurate and pertinacious about civil liberties like freedom of speech because I want limits placed on power. I am also adamantly pro-choice and anti-death penalty. But there is really no political ideology that I do not hold in the utmost contempt, hence why I went absolutely out of my way to enrage every single political sect on the planet, from the extreme left to the extreme right and everything in between.
    

- **I trolled to infiltrate and give info to FBI or journalist**
    
    It was always my intention to infiltrate online jihadist spheres so that I could eventually become either a journalist, an FBI agent, or both. My lawyer found that I had indeed searched for anonymous FBI and AFP (Australian Federal Police) tip lines, supporting my claim that I would have tipped off police about the bogus terror plot that I was false-flagging.
    
    […]
    
    Luke McMahon contacted her after seeing me chatting with her on Twitter, and she inadvertently helped him verify my identity. I then had a conversation with her about it, and I told her that I had been posing as a terrorist in an effort to infiltrate their ranks and hopefully become a journalist/FBI agent
    

- **I never thought this guys could make terrorsit attacks**
    
    I’m on the record as telling Luke McMahon that I didn’t think that any of the jihadists who I was talking to would actually do anything because, in my own words, “these guys are pussy keyboard warriors”. I knew that anyone who attempted to attack Pamela Geller’s agitprop “Draw Muhammad” event would get shot immediately since the event had extremely heavy security (and, indeed, that’s exactly what happened). Likewise, I knew that the Kansas City Stairclimb had heavy security as well, and that anyone who attempted to bring a bomb there would get arrested. If I was really trying to incite real terrorist attacks, I would have just told someone to ram their car into pedestrians.
    
    […]
    
    And I did not think that there was any chance that this individual — who claimed to be a teenager — would actually be able to make a real, working bomb anyways. I figured that they would blow themselves up and that, even if they did somehow manage to create a bomb, there was zero chance that they would actually be able to place it at the Kansas City Stairclimb (an event with HEAVY security) without getting caught.
    
- **I’m nihilist**
    
    I did it purely to see the shitstorm that I knew it would create, not because I actually care in the least about anything involving either Shaun King or Milo Yiannopoulos 
    
    […]
    
    **although, again, my intentions were purely nihilistic and apolitical in nature; I am certainly not a Zionist and I am certainly not some dildo-waving Antifa moron either**
    
- **I wanted to make fun of stirring things up + Rebelling against everything**
    
    When the question was posed as to why I did what I did online, one user summed it up as follows: “The fun of stirring things up and causing trouble I suppose. Rebelling against everything, because he hates normal life and doesn’t fit into it.” There has never been a more accurate description of me than that.
    
- **I wanted to see how far I could go before raising objections (neonazis)**
    
    As “Michael Slay”/”European88", I often tried to see how disgusting and repugnant I could possibly get before even neo-Nazis would begin to raise objections. Unsurprisingly, they never did.
    
- **I liked the idea of having an army. Misanthropic desire to act as nihilistic chaos agent**
    
    I liked the idea of having a virtual army of neo-Nazi troglodytes at my disposal, which I could use to wreak havoc on the internet. And, indeed, that’s exactly what I did. As Jim Treacher put it when describing me in The Daily Caller: “He set Jews and Muslims against each other, feminists vs. videogame nerds, Nazis vs. everybody.” Motivated by the misanthropic desire to act as a nihilistic chaos agent, there was zero ideology behind the anarchic mischief-making that I engaged in online. Much like The Joker, I just wanted to watch the world burn.
    
    […]
    
    As previously stated, I liked the idea of having a virtual army of moronic myrmidons who would follow my every command and who I could use to drop atomic drama bombs on the internet — and, indeed, that’s exactly what I did. 
    
- **“ Rather, I did it for the same reason that I did most things: because I could.”**
- **Trolling was a way to release some of my hate out of society**
- **I targeted people who deserved it**
    
    But, to my credit: when I engaged in destructive and antisocial trolling of that nature, I did try to target people who deserved it, and it’s pretty hard to think of anyone much more deserving of being trolled than neo-Nazis.
    

**I am putting this out as my first public statement to clear up some misconceptions that have been circulated about me.**

- **I’m not a sick, evil, flagitious terrorist**
    
    The public thinks that I’m a sick, evil, flagitious terrorist, as that’s what the news coverage surrounding me portrayed me as. When I spoke to Luke McMahon, I wanted him to be intimidated by me, so I tried to portray myself as a frightening psychopath, like a cyber-Hannibal Lecter. But, while I may not be a paragon of virtue, I am not a terrorist either. In reality, I never remotely thought that my actions would cause real terrorist attacks.
    
- **I’m not /u/Philosophyofrape, I’m not a rapist**
    
    I was not /u/Jewish_Neocon and I was not /u/PhilosophyOfRape either. While I briefly had European88 latch onto the whole “Philosophy of Rape” thing in order to establish him as the most vile and despicable neo-Nazi on the internet (and, of course, to drum up outrage), that was the full extent of my involvement (the alt-right constantly spews vitriol about the evils of pure white women being raped and defiled by filthy shitskins, yet they themselves tend to view rape as a suitable punishment for those winsome trollops gallivanting about in wanton licentiousness). I had nothing to do with the original /r/PhilosophyOfRape subreddit. I had spoken to /u/PhilosophyOfRape a few times (as European88) and he really came across like a genuine rapist who sincerely believed his sick ideology, rather than just a juvenile troll merely trying to get a rise out of people. Rest assured that I am not now, nor have I ever been (and nor will I ever be) a rapist. Troll, yes. Rapist, no. Of all of the bottom-feeding plankton that I’m surrounded by in prison, the sexual predators are the ones that I despise the most.
    

- **I was not a Hikkikomori, I could have a social and sex life if I wanted to**
    
    While I have been widely labeled as a NEET/hikkikomori, I was not. I did live with my parents at the time of my arrest, but I was enrolled in college courses and was moving to a college campus soon. And I was not a basement-dweller, as there are no basements in Florida. But I did generally base my life around avoiding other people as much as I possibly could. However, in stark contrast to the average basement-dweller, I had no social life not because I was a disgusting creep (I wasn’t), but simply because I generally can’t stand being around other people in real life. I could have had an active social life (and sex life) if I had wanted to. It was simply that I didn’t want to, and I still don’t want to. I guess you can chalk that up to me being a sperglord.
    

- **I look like the typical mass shooter, but I’m not violent**
    
    I’ll admit, I do perfectly fit the mold of the typical mass shooter. Someone on IMDb once told me as such: “Okay, so let’s recap: you are sexually repressed, you hate the human race, and you identify with homicidal maniacs. I really hope I don’t live anywhere near you.” But, while I might constantly vent violent fantasies (I’ve repeatedly been castigated for expressing fantasies about torturing and killing the sex offenders in prison), I have never actually been violent with anyone and I never will be. At my trial, my mother said to the courtroom, choking back tears, that “the only person I ever thought Joshua would hurt was Joshua.”
    
- **I’m not a sociopath**
    
    The only inmates who I genuinely sympathized with were the valetudinarians at Butner FMC — sickly, ashen, emaciated, confused, and languidly zombie-walking through the unit with hydrocephalytic torpidity. When I was there, I tried my best to take care of the guys who couldn’t take care of themselves, like the blind and demented ones. That — coupled with my love of animals (to the extent that I was actually a vegetarian from the time I was 10 right up until my arrest) — provides perhaps the most compelling evidence that I am not a sociopath.
    
- **I’m not a GamerGate looser**
    
    I am not remotely a bigot in real life, nor am I even a conservative, nor am I a #GamerGate loser or a supporter of that attention-seeking buffoon Milo Yiannopoulos
    

- **I’m not alt-right**
    
    In addition, I wish that my “Mariam Veiszadeh is a Muslim whore” comment hadn’t been published, as it made me look like an alt-right bigot. I honestly don’t even remember saying that. I have a tendency to just say things for shock value, which has gotten me in trouble for my entire life.
    

- **I’m not antifa**
    
    **although, again, my intentions were purely nihilistic and apolitical in nature; I am certainly not a Zionist and I am certainly not some dildo-waving Antifa moron either**
    

- **I have no real political allegiances**
    
    I have no real political allegiances, and I never really gave a damn about dumb neckbeard political movements like #GamerGate. My trolling was purely of the equal-opportunity “doing it for the lulz” variety.
    
    […]
    
    Rather, I was a true troll, not motivated by any particular ideology, but driven only by the misanthropic desire to act as hostis humani generis, trying my best to always be an enemy of everyone and an ally of no one.
    

- **I accomplished nothing**
    
    But, much like being a persona factory, is being the world’s greatest troll really something that anyone should strive for? Is “KING OF TROLLS” really something that anyone should want on their tombstone? No, of course not. In the end, I accomplished absolutely nothing other than landing myself in federal prison.
    

- **I Humiliated and discredited Andrew Anglin and the jihadist twitter scene, Im V for Vendetta.**
    
    Say what you want about my character, but I did what no “le Anomalous leejun” idiot could ever do: I completely humiliated and discredited Andrew Anglin, and I also humiliated and discredited the jihadist Twitter sphere that embraced “Australi Witness”. That’s the kind of thing that no V for Vendetta mask-wearing script kiddie could ever dream of accomplishing.
    
- **I was the most prolific and succesful troll**
    
    There are countless more examples. Make no mistake about it: I was, without a doubt, the most prolific and successful troll in the history of the internet
    
    […]
    
    From my childhood until 2015, I was the most prolific troll in the history of the internet, being involved in a dizzying array of dramas and controversies on the web and essentially acting as a nihilistic chaos agent, taking multiple sides on every single issue under a staggering number of fake identities .
    
- **I thought I was helping Ben Garrison by buzzing him, I never edited his cartoons**
    
    With that said, Benny G VASTLY overestimates the extent to which I was harassing him. I did create most of the neo-Nazi “Ben Garrison quote” images attributed to him (which were made in MS Paint), but that was pretty much all that I did. I never edited any of his cartoons, as I don’t know Photoshop, and I had nothing to do with the “Goldman Sachs paper rain” series of Facebook pages either. Also, I genuinely had no idea that the trolling had any real effect on his personal life/finances. To the contrary, in fact, I thought that it was helping him by making him more famous. And, in the end, it did help him. He himself said that, without the trolls, he would still be just some obscure Montana crank posting cartoons on a blog. […] You’re welcome, Ben.
    
- **Catlin Roper would have agreed with what I said in her name**
    
    The real Caitlin Roper is a hardcore TERF who would wholeheartedly agree with the bilious anti-transgender messages that I sent out under her name: [http://archive.fo/d4KHN](http://archive.fo/d4KHN)
    
- **I don’t like porn and sex, I’ve seen horrible things since I’m 11**
    
    Under my various online accounts, I’ve posted all manner of straight porn, gay porn, lesbian porn, and sick fetish porn. In reality, I don’t like porn and I don’t like sex. With that said, I have always had a detached, morbid fascination with sick and deviant sexual practices. By the time I was 11, I had already received heavy exposure to the sickest, most depraved porn that exists on the surface web. When I was 12, I maintained a massive list of shock sites over at BluWiki (a list which I’m sure is still up), was a regular on the Meatspin forums, and frequently used shock images (especially the notorious “BABYFUCK, BABYFUCK” page from Mai-chan’s Daily Life) to get a reaction out of people on forums like Gaia Online. No child who is exposed to stuff like that on a regular basis is going to come out normal and with conventional attitudes about sex.
    
- **I look at people and I see nothing worth liking**
    
    At the very least, prison cannot possibly turn me into any more of an extreme misanthrope than I already was. To steal a line from Daniel Day-Lewis, I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.
    
- **You have nothing to gain at being a troll**
    
    on that note, I hope that my story will provide a cautionary warning to any other internet trolls out there. You’re never as anonymous as you think, and the life of a troll will only lead you down a road to ruin. You have nothing to gain and everything to lose.
    
- **Autism is a giant mark of shame that I will carry around on my shoulders for the rest of my life**
    
    I really wish that it hadn’t been revealed to the public that I have autism. I do not have a positive view of autistic people, and neither does anyone else (although many will pretend to). Autism is a giant mark of shame that I will carry around on my shoulders for the rest of my life. But, if you look at my online activities, there are a number of tell-tale signs that I’m autistic. Aside from being extremely sarcastic and adept at metaphors, there are very few characteristics of autism that I don’t demonstrate.
    
- **I hate pictures of me, and don’t say I’m fat**
    
    I also wish that I had taken greater care to ensure that there were no pictures of me on the internet. If I had seen my sister post that family photo with me in it, I would have asked her to take it down. There are very few things that I hate more than having my picture taken, and I like to have a mysterious, enigmatic aura surrounding me. With that said, I am a bit confused about the descriptions of me as being fat. I mean, I honestly couldn’t care less if people think that I’m fat, but I’m not. I’m not even chubby. I weigh about 190 pounds. All I can figure is that people are extrapolating. They think that, since I was an internet troll living the sessile, tenebrous life of an asocial recluse, I must therefore be fat. My cloistered lifestyle was indeed characterized by listless indolence, but I wasn’t exactly eating a surfeit of junk food on a regular basis.
    
    - **I’m not a conservative ideologue, I voted for Obama**
        
        Markos Moulitsas — the Sean Hannity of the left, dogmatically pontificating regurgitated DNC talking points like a glassy-eyed automaton — attempted to paint me as a conservative ideologue trying to cause terrorist attacks so that I could then blame them on Obama, which is a supposition that anyone who knows me would absolutely laugh at (and I love how he name-dropped the Australian Human Rights Law Centre, even though he had indubitably never even heard of them before). In 2012, I was incredibly vociferous and obnoxious in my vehement support for Obama’s re-election.
        
- **Note on prison, and not being on internet**
    
    Acclimatizing to the thoroughly insalubrious environment of prison is never easy, especially for someone who based their entire life around the internet. When one is in prison, it is extremely difficult to feel anything other than total impuissance. But that’s how I felt when I was on the street as well. I feel utterly trapped and completely powerless in this horrible world that I never would have willingly chosen to be born into. I’m terrified of death, but I truly wish more than anything that I had never been born in the first place.
