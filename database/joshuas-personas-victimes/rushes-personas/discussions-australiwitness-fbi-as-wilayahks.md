July 27, 2015 06:51
CHS - **Nothing much ahki. It's nice to talk with
you. You've gotten kind of famous lately lol -*SMILE***

July 27, 2015 19:41
**AusWitness - Really? Where am l famous?**

July 28, 201 5 15:07
CHS - I **read a news article after garland and it had your name in it**

July 28, 2015 15:08
CHS - **So I said Alhamdulillah maybe we can chat Smile**

JulY 28,2015 22:02
Au'sWitness - **Yes, the kuffer media did cover me after Garland**

July 28, 2015 22:04
AusWitness - **Right now, I'm trying to get a mujahid in Melbourne to carry out jihad, but he keeps delaying it. He has a gun already, but he insists on making a video message to the kuffar with a black shahada flag. He also insists on getting his friend to carry out jihad with him. I am afraid he'll get caught before he can do it.**

JulY 30,2015 21:54
AusWitness - **Are you in Australia, brother?**

JulY 31 , 2015 05:29
CHS - **No, l'm in the states ahki**

AusWitness - **Right now, it's @aussecret**

*8/5/15 8:38 AM*

**wilayahks**
Well bro he hasn 't gotten back to
me ...

*8/5/15 1:10 PM*

**AusWitness**
If he was captured, it would be
my fault. I mentioned him in a
post on a discussion board for
mujahideen. I feel so guilty
about this. I am so worried
about him.

*8/5/15 1 :11 PM*

**AusWitness**
If the kuffar captured him with
his gun, it would be on the
news, right?

*8/6/15 7:40 AM*

**wilayahks**
I would assume?

*8/6/15 7:42 AM*

**wilayahks**

I don't know what to tell you bro 
*8/6/15 11 :08 AM*
**AusWitness**
The thread I posted about him was on [8ch.net/islamicstate](http://8ch.net/islamicstate).
Do you think the kuffar could capture him just from that thread?

*8/7/15 8:12 AM*

**wilahayks**
No I mean it's an onion site
*8/7/15 8:12 AM*
And surespot isn't traceable
*8/7/15 8:12 AM*
Sounds like he got cold feet to be honest

![20180506.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180506.png)

*8/7/15 10:38 PM*

**AusWitness**
Well, I posted a link to a video he posted. Couldn't the kuffar trace his I P from that? Or from
his Twitter, which has the same username?
*8/7/15 10:39 PM*
He often takes a long time to respond to me, but it's never taken THIS long. The last thing
he sent me was a promise that he would send me updates more often.

![20180507.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180507.png)

*8/8/15 10:31 PM*

**AusWitness**
These are the last messages he sent me.

*8/9/15 12:23 PM*

**wilayahks**
Yeah ahki I dunno there's not much you can do at this point

![20180508.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180508.png)

*8/9/2015 12:23 pm*

**wilayahks**

The bottom line is if you feel safe being caught shouldn 't be an issue
*8/9/15 12:23 PM*
You can always plan something else

*8/10/15 1 :16 AM*

**AusWitness**
What makes it worse is that he hasn't responded to my emails or my messages on Twitter either. But, if the kuffar had
captured him, then surely it would be on the news? I just don't understand.

*8/10/15 8:17 AM*

**wilayahks**
Yes it would have been on the news they love showing that kind of news

![20180509.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180509.png)

*8/10/15 8:23 AM*

**wilayakhs**
If they got him they'd have gotten you right?

*8/10/15 9:51 PM*

**AusWitness**
Well, l 'm not sure. I mean, I used proxies to post. I don't
think he used a proxy to upload that video clip that I posted.
*8/10/15 9:51 PM*
l've tried messaging him on Twitter and emailing him, but I get nothing.

*8/12/15 10:21 PM*

**wilayahks**
Cold feet bro

![20180510.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180510.png)

*8/13/15 2:22 AM*
**AusWitness**
But his last messages showed no sign of cold feet, brother. I just wish I hadn 't made that
stupid thread on Behan. What was I thinking?

*8/13/15 7:24 AM*

**wilayahks**
Don't beat yourself up ahki.
*8/13/15 7:25 AM*
If he were arrested it would be in the news
*8/13/15 7:25 AM*
If you're serious its time to focus on other things. Don't get tied down by it.

![20180512.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180512.png)

*8/13/154:41 PM*

**wilayahks**
Maybe he went here ahki ~
*8/13/15 4:42 PM*
Jokes aside may Allah swt bless them all

![20180513.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180513.png)

*8/14/15 7:07 AM*

**AusWitness**
I just can't get over this, akhi.
The kuffar government could be torturing him for info right now, and ail because I made
the stupid mistake of talking about our plans on Behan. If I find out he got caught because
of me, I just don't know what I’ll do. I feel like I have failed as a Muslim.

*8/1 4/15 7 :30 AM*

**wilayahks**
Best to get that out of your head
ahki. He knew the risks when he started planning. We all do.

![20180514.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180514.png)

*8/14/15 7:41 AM*
**wilayahks**
Why Australia bro? Just curious. Are they as bad as the US?

*8/15/15 12:37 AM*

**AusWitness**
But, if I hadn't made a thread about our plans, he would n 't have been caught. And yes,
Australia is as bad as the US.

*8/15/15 7:40 AM*

**wilayahks**
But you don't know he's been caught.
*8/15/15 8:26 PM*
Where did you find him in the first place?

![20180515.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180515.png)

*8/16/15 10:40 PM*

**wilayahks**
Salaam bro

*8/16/15 11 :39 PM*

**AusWitness**
Salaam, brother.

*8/17/15 6:54 PM*

**wilayahks**
Salaam ahki

*8/17 /15 9:56 PM*

**AusWitness**
Salaam. I made a Facebook account and added some of mohamadmo7's friends on
Facebook. Hopefully, they will be able to give me so info.

*8/17/15 9:57 PM*

**wilayahks**
lnshallah
*8/17 /15 9:57 PM*
How are you bro?

![20180516.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180516.png)

*8/17 /15 10:03 PM*

**AusWitness**
l'm still worried, akhi.

8/17/15 10:04 PM
**wilayahks**
I know Ahki I can tell. lt's all you talk about. I feel bad that you're going through this. My Allah swt ease your
mind.
*8/17/15 10:06 PM*
Let's talk about something else. Get your mind off it. What's Australia like? What do you do? l'm ready to
start another year of college.

![20180517.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180517.png)

*8/17/15 10:07 PM*

**wilayahks**
Honestly bro I found you and was like this brother is the haqq a true
mujahid lol it's weird seeing you this wrapped up in someone else. I feel
bad bro.
*8/17/15 10:12 PM*
This is the life though Ahki
*8/17/15 10:13 PM*
A few weeks ago I remember a lot of brothers in the U.S. Got arrested like
a bunch of them. They were all still proud.
*8/17/15 10:19 PM*
I was arrested a few days after. Released after a weekend. Was talking to a brother in the dawlah
when it happened. Kuff legal system bro. l’m sure Ahki is fine.

![20180517-2.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180517-2.png)

*8/17/15 10:26 PM*

**AusWitness**
What were you arrested for, akhi?

*8/17/15 10:26 PM*

**wilayahks**
lllegally transporting a weapon
*8/17/15 10:27 PM*
A bro in the dawlah and i were planning something but Allah s guiged me elsewhere
*8/17/15 10:28 PM*
Temporarily inshallah
*8/17/15 10:30 PM*
Like I said in and out the paperwork was fine I was never even charged

*8/17/15 10:36 PM*

**AusWitness**
How did you avoid getting
charged, brother? The Australian legal system is much stricter about guns.

![20180517-3.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180517-3.png)

*8/17/15 10:39 PM*

**wilayahks**
They detained me for 72 hours because they're filthy kuff but that was it
*8/17/15 10:44 PM*
lt's funny the Kuff law is exactly what was it

![20180517-4.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180517-4.png)

*8/17/15 10:44 PM*

**wilayahks**
lt' s funny the Kuff law is exactly what will do them in. Lol it's sooo easy to
get a gun especially in the Midwest. No idea what Australia is like. I always thought they were gun friendly.

*8/17/15 10:47 PM*

**AusWitness**
Australia has strict gun laws, but mohamadmo7 was able to buy a gun from a black market
weapons dealer. He bought an SKS rifle, which I' m pretty sure is illegal here. If the kuffar
found him, he could get a long prison sentence for owning an illegal gun and planning jihad .

![20180517-6.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180517-6.png)

*8/17/15 10:48 PM*

**wilayahks**
Bithnillah he is safe

*8/17/15 10:57 PM*

**AusWitness**
I hope so, akhi. May Allah (SWT) guard him from the
kuffar and keep him safe.

*8/17/15 10:58 PM*
Did you hear the kuffar media talking about how lslamic
State mujahideen were supposedly gonna blow up the
Queen of England a few days ago?

*8/17/15 10:59 PM*

**wilayahks**
I heard something of it but didn't read much of it

*8/17 /1 5 11 :07 PM*

**AusWitness**
I was actually really disappointed when it didn't happen. The UK needs a new 7 /7. They kill our brothers and
sisters all over the world.

*8/17/1511 :08 PM*

**wilayahks**
The UK is one of many that deserve it. We were supposed to have a few
ops here on July 4 that didn't happen. lt was so disappointing.

![20180517-8.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180517-8.png)

out. l learned a lot planning with the Syrian brother.

Salaam bro

*8/19/15 12:58 AM*

**AusWitness**
That sounds good. What do you have in mind? Do you have any bombs ready?
*8/19/15 4:05 AM*
Akhi, mohamadmo7 just sent me a few messages. He said he was upset that I made that
thread, and he's been hiding because he was worried about being caught. What can I do to
make him feel better?

![20180518.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20180518.png)

(…)

*8/19/15 6:27 AM*

**AusWitness**
I agree with you, akhi. But he says he was trying to be
secure and the thread put him at risk of being caught by the
kuffar. He's very upset about it. I just hope he doesn't stay mad.
*8/19/15 6:28 AM*

What weapons do you have, brother? I can send you guides

I agree, akhi. But what about my plans with mohamadmo7?

There's no reason you can't plan bath. Honestly it sounds like he is very hesitant anyway.

l'm going to go to bed now because it's nighttime here,
but would you be willing to talk to him soon? I need a mujahid
like you to reassure him that I didn't put him in any danger
and that he should still go through with the plans.

*8/19/15 7:29 AM*

A heart that beats for Allah does not need reassurances bro. Lots of
people talk big on the Internet. Only Allah has not steeled his heart yet. Only Allah knows why.

Well, before he disappeared last time, he was insisting that,
before carrying out the attack, he wanted a make a video
message to the kuffar with a black shahada flag, and he
also wanted to bring his friend along to carry out the attack
with him. He said he wouldn't be a good Muslim if he didn't
give his friend the opportunity to become a martyr with him.
*8/20/15 12:40 AM*
He clearly wants to attack, since he sold his car to buy a
gun. lt's just so frustrating that I can never seem to get him to
actually do it.

*8/20/15 1 :18 AM*
He hasn't responded yet.

Yes I' m leaning towards that too. l 've been getting excited about this. l 've
been having trouble with the planners in the dawlah who want me to just do
a gun attack. But that doesn't seem big enough to bring true glory to

there is no way they will find me.

Let them scramble for the needle in the
haystack. lt will only add to their fears
and please Allah swt

**AusWitness**
*8/30/15 10:26 PM*
Thanks, akhi. lt's just really
upsetting how I promised the
kuffar that an attack would
happen in Melbourne and it
never did. Now some
mujahideen think I' m a fake.

**wilayahks**
*8/30/15 10:27 PM*

There is a RadioShack around l'm

8/31/15 6:53 AM
I'm glad to hear it, bro. Just
sell your TV and you should be
able to get the remote control
parts for about $20, plus the
bus ticket for about $40. Then,
when the day of reckoning
cornes, be extra careful, avoid
acting suspicious, and then
blow the kuffar to pieces, Allah
(SWT) willing.

Perfect. Just keep a safe
distance from the bomb. Vou
don't wanna get hit with any
shrapnel. And, when you're
carrying the bomb in your
backpack, just try to make
yourself look like everyone else
to avoid suspicion. Look down
at your phone and pretend to
text if the kuffar start looking at
you suspiciously.

Are you ready for this ahki
*9/9/15 7:41 AM*
We will be lions among the kuffar

**AusWitness**
*9/9/15 12:24 PM*
I am ready, akhi. I am so
excited. We will be legendary
mujahideen, and Allah (SWl)
will reward us with seats right
next to the Prophet (PBUH) in
Jannah. These filthy kuffar will
be brought to their knees at
our unwavering dedication to
Allah (SWl). l'm so glad to
hear you got the ticket,
brother. You looked at the map
of where the event is, right,
akhi? You have it all planned
out?

you gave me. I can't think of
anything else.

**AusWitness**
9/9/15 12:31 PM
Make sure to detonate when
the maximum amount of kuffar
are around, akhi. When it gets
the most crowded, then
detonate lt.

anticipation. I can’t get back to sleep

**AusWitness**

I know how you feel, akhi. I am
so excited that I can hardly
sleep. I can't wait for the day
to come.

**wilayahks**
*9/9/15 12:36 PM*
Will you be around this week? l'm
getting paranoid I guess, I didn't hear
from you in a while.

**AusWitness**

*9/9/15 12:36 PM*
Of course I’II be around, akhi. I
would never abandon a
mujahid.

**wilayahks**
*9/9/15 12:37 PM*
Jzk brother
*9/9/15 12:38 PM*
I get especially worried in the
mornings. lt's so quiet. I just sit
there and I can hear the screaming
kuffar.

**AusWitness**
*9/9/15 12:38 PM*
Yeah, I keep picturing it in my
head. The explosion, the kuffar
panicking, the kafir politicians
freaking out. lt’s going to be
glorious, brother.

*9/9/15 12:39 PM*
Alhamdulillah
*9/9/15 12:40 PM*
How many do you think we can kill?

**AusWitness**
*9/9/15 12:40 PM*
At least 30 or so.

**wilayahks**
*9/9/15 12:43 PM*
Subhanallah
*9/9/15 12:43 PM*
I only worry if Allah swt will be upset
if we kill any infants
*9/9/1512:43 PM*
Or something like that you know?
*9/9/15 12:43 PM*
That kind of bothers me

**AusWitness**

*9/9/15 12:44 PM*
Don't worry, akhi. Nobody
brings infants to these sorts of
things. lt's a firefighter event
on a hot day. Infants would just
cry the whole time.

**wilayahks**
*9/9/15 12:45 PM*
What about the familias of the kuff
firefighters

![20150909-9.PNG](Discussions%20AustraliWitness%20FBI%20as%20wilayahks%20b739d7e451b5442da6250bda588d450c/20150909-9.png)

**AusWitness**

*9/9/15 12:47 PM*
They'd leave any babies at
home with babysitters. lt would
just be adults and teenagers at
the event. Plus, I think the
firefighter familias are in a
different section from the main
crowd.

**wilayahks**
*9/9/15 12:47 PM*
If I see babies should I move the
bomb
*9/9/15 12:4 7 PM*
I don’t know how powerful it will be
*9/9/15 12:47 PM*
I used the full two lbs that I got of the gunpowder

**AusWitness**

*9/9/2015 12:50 PM*

If you see babies, wait for them
to leave. Mothers with babies
wouldn't stay very long, akhi.
They would leave once the
babies start crying.

**wilayahks**
*9/9/15 12:51 PM*
If they don't leave is it permissible to
kill them? l'm sure most of the
firefighters are military kuff.
*9/9/15 12:52 PM*
Their families are guilty in the eyes of
Allah

**AusWitness**

*9/9/15 12:53 PM*
lndeed, brother. Allah (SWT)
permits us to kill the families of
military kuffar. They're guilty in
the eyes of Allah (SWT) since
they support the invasion and
bombing of Muslim lands.

**wilayahks**
*9/9/15 12:54 PM*
I worry that an innocent child might
get caught in the blast. I need to get
Jannah with this bro
*9/9/15 12:54 PM*
Seriously

**AusWitness**
*9/9/15 12:56 PM*
Akhi, don't worry. Muslims
would not attend this event.
Only military supporters would,
and all military supporters are
guilty in the eyes of Allah
(SWT) .

Yes, akhi, we will set off a

live in criplling fear.
