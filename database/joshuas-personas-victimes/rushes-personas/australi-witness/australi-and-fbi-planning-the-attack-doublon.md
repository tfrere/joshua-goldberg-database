# Australi and FBI planning the attack (doublon)

AusWitness - **Have you decided what kind of attack to carry out on 9/11, akhi? I was thinking of a bombing.**

CHS - **Yes I'm leaning towards that too. I've been getting excited about this. l've
been having trouble with the planners in the dawlah who want me to just do a gun attack. But that doesn't seem big enough to bing true glory to Allah. Look at Chaftanooga the kuff have already forgetten.**

AusWitness - **What city are you in, akhi? We need to find the best place to place the explosive.**

CHS - **l'm in the Midwest, the closest place is Kansas City if you're familiar, but I can travel I'm just a student**

AusWifness - **Alright, so will you be able to drive to Kansas City to carry out the attack?**

CHS - **Yes Easily**

AusMfness - [And] **Do you have the bomb ready, akhi?**

CHS - **No I haven't even started getting matterials, what do you think for this bro? What will cause the most damage ?**

AusWitness - **Use shards of metal and nails, akhi.**

CHS - **Ok I'll get a bunch of screws and stuff**

AusWitness - **Broken glass would probably work too. Just put as much sharp stuff as you can in there.** **lf you can, dip the screws and other shrapnel in rat Poison before putting them in. That way, the kuffar who get hit by them will be more likely to die.**

**CHS - I'm thinking of filming and shouting allahu ahkbar right before it goes off, we will put the video online and the muiahideen will be heroes** 

Auswitness - **Indeed, akhi. The kuffar will speak our names with tenor in their voices.**
