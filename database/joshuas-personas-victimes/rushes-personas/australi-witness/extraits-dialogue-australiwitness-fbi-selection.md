CHS - **So I said Alhamdulillah maybe we can chat *Smile***

*JulY 28,2015 22:02*
Au'sWitness - **Yes, the kuffer media did cover me after Garland**

*July 28, 2015 22:04*
AusWitness - **Right now, I'm trying to get a mujahid in Melbourne to carry out jihad, but he keeps delaying it. He has a gun already, but he insists on making a video message to the kuffar with a black shahada flag. He also insists on getting his friend to carry out jihad with him. I am afraid he'll get caught before he can do it.**

*JulY 30,2015 21:54*
AusWitness - **Are you in Australia, brother?**

*JulY 31 , 2015 05:29*
CHS - **No, l'm in the states ahki**

*JulY 31, 2015 22:17*
AusWitness - **Did we speak to each other on Twitter, brother?**

*August 1,2015 05:32*
CHS - **No what's your twitter?**

*August 1,2015 22:27*
AusWitness - **Right now, it's @aussecret**

*August 5,2015*
AusWitness - *13:10* **lf he was captured, it would be my fault. I mentioned him in a post on a discusslon board for mujahideen. I feel so guilty about this. I am so worried about him.**
*August 5, 2015*
AusWitness - 44.44 **If the kuffar captured him with his gun, it would be on the news, right?**

*****August 6,2015 07:40*
CHS - **I would assume?**
*August 6,2015 07:42*
CHS - **I don't know what to tell you bro**

*****August 6,2015 11:08*
AusWitness - **The thread I posted about him was on** [8ch.net/islamicstate](http://sch.net/islamicstate)**. Do you think the kuffar could capture him just from that thread?**

*****August 14,2015 07:07*
AusWitness - **I just can't get over this, akhi. The kuffar govemment could be torturing him for info right now, and all because I made the stupid mistake of talking about our plans on 8chan. If I find out he got caught because of me, l just don't know what I’ll do. I feel like I have failed as a Muslim.**

*August 14,2015 07:30*
CHS - **Best to get that out of your head ahki. He knew the risks when he started planning. We all do.**

*August 14,2015 07:41*
CHS - **Why Australia bro? Just curious. Are they as bad as the US?** 

*August 15,2015 00:37*
AusWitness - **But, if I hadn't made a thread about our plans, he wouldn’t have been caught. And yes, Australia is as bad as the US.**

*August 15,2015 07:40*
CHS - **But you don't know he's been caught.**
*August 15,2015 20:26*
CHS - **Where did you find him in the first place?**

*August 15,2015 22:39*
AusWitness - **I first met him on Twitter, but we never talked until he emailed me.**

*August 15,2015 07:27*
CHS - **I don't know what else to say ahki.**

*August 15,2015 07:33*
irons CHS - **Maybe we can Put some more irons in the fire bro. I think we're on the same Page as far as ideas go.**

*August 17,2015 22:59*
CHS - **I heard something of it but didn't read much of it.**

*August 17, 2015 23:07*
AusWitness - **I was actually really disappointed when it didn't happen. The UK needs a new 7/7. They kill our brothers and sisters all over the world.**

*August 17, 2015 23:08*
CHS - **The UK is one of many that deserve it. We were supposed to have a few oPs
here on July 4 that didn't happen. lt was so disappointing.**

*August 17, 2015 23:15*
CHS - **Hey bro I'm going to bed. We'll talk more tomorrow. Hit me uP in the daY if you want maybe I'll be around. Salaam**

*August 17,2015 23:34*

*August 17, 2015 23:34*
AusWitness - **Alight, brother, Salaam.**

*August 18,2015 08:46*

*Aug18, 2015 20:12*
CHS - **Salaambro**

*August 19,2015 06:28*
AusWitness - **What weapons do you have brother? I can send you guides on how to make bombs if you need help making them.**

*August 19,2015 06:29*
CHS - **I only have the one weapon but I don’t think that is what Allah wants for me. I
was arrested just before with the one weapon. Guides would be great ahki
something bigger than iust a gun aftack alhamdulillah.**

*August 19,2015 06:44*
AusWitness - **Alright, akhi. I'm gonna send you some bomb-making guides on Twitter soon.**

AusWitness - **Let me now if you need any more,
brother. I'll help as much as I can.**

*August 20, 2015 07:03*
AusWitness - **Have you decided what kind of attack to carry out on 9/11, akhi? I was thinking a bombing.**

*August 20, 2015*
AusWitness - 07:06 **We could make pipe bombs and detonate them at a large public event.**

*August 20, 2015, 07:06*
CHS - **Yes I'm leaning towards that too. I've been getting excited about this. l've
been having trouble with the planners in the dawlah who want me to just do a gun attack. But that doesn't seem big enough to bing true glory to Allah. Look at Chaftanooga the kuff have already forgetten.**

*August 20, 2015, 07:O7*
AusWitness - **Exactly, brother. lt needs to be big. Do you live in NYC? I'm in Perth. There are lots of places to target here.** 

*August 20, 2015 07:07*
CHS - **Do you know the directions you gave me work? I've never made a bomb before lol sorry**

*August 20, 2015 07:08*
AusWitness - **They work, akhi. But a pressure cooker bomb might be even better. Let me ask one of my brothers in the dawlah for instructions.**

*August 20, 2015 07:10*
CHS - **Ok. ahki.**

*August 20, 2015 07:13*
AusWitness - **What city are you in, akhi? We need to find the best place to place the explosive.**

*August 20,2015 07:13*
CHS - **l'm in the Midwest fhe closest place is Kansas City if you're familiar**

*August 20,2015 07:13*
CHS - **But I can travel I'm just a student**

*August 20, 2015 07:14*
AusWitness - **Alright, so will you be able to drive to Kansas City to carry out the attack?**

*August 20, 2015 07:14*
CHS - **Yes Easily**

*Aug 24,2015 00:56*
AusWitness - **What did you think of the pressure cooker instructions?**

*Aug 24,2015 08:30*
CHS - **Yeah that makes sense. What kind of targets are you thinking? How will we
publicize it too**

*Aug 24,2015 08:36*
AusWitness - **Where will the most people be in Kansas City on 9/11? That's where we need to target.**

*Aug 24,2015 08:37*
CHS - **No idea I'm about an hour west**

*Aug 24,2015 08:37*
CHS - **I don't go that often**

*Aug 24,2015 08:42*
AusWitness - **I found the perfect place. Go to kansascitystairclimb.com**

*Aug 24,2015 08:43*
CHS - **Yes that's peffect I'm looking at it.**

*Aug 24,2015 08:49*
AusWitness - **Do you have the bomb ready, akhi?**

*Aug 24,2015 08:51*
CHS - **No I haven't even started getting matterials**

*Aug 24,2015 08:55*
AusWitness - **Be careful, brother. Don't buy all the materials at once or the kuffar will know you're up to something. Buy them at different stores.**

*Aug 24,2015 10:24*
CHS - **Yeah that's what I was thinking**

*Aug 27, 2015, 08:22*
AusWitness - **Be careful, akhi. When You go there to place the bomb, make
sure the bomb is VERY well hidden.**

*Aug 27, 2015, 08:22*
CHS - **It sometimes overheats I want to make sure on the day of I can get there no problems**

*Aug 27, 2015, 08:23*
CHS - **Yes t'm going to Put it in the backpack**

*Aug 27,2015, 08:23*
CHS - **Where do you think would be best near the fire fighters or the crowd**

*Aug 27, 2015, 08:24*
AusWitness - **Good thinking, akhi. Put the backpack near the crowd.**

*Aug 27, 2015, 08:24*
AusWitness - **But make sure it’s in a place where the kuffar won't think anything of it.**

*Aug 28,2015, 07:49*
CHS - **Hey I'm going to Walmart after class after afternoon and getting the rest of what I need.**

*Aug 28,2015, 07:49*
CHS - **The instructions you have me said to put something in the pressure cooker that will act as like a shrapnel**

*Aug 28, 2015, 07:50*
AusWitness - **Well, he could be telling other mujahideen a bunch of lies about me so they won't trust me.**

*Aug 28, 2015, 07:50*
CHS - **What do you think for this bro? What will cause the most damage.**

*Aug 28, 2015, 07:50*
AusWitness - **Hold on, let me ask some mujahideen.**

*Aug 28,2015 07:50*
CHS - **Jzk**

*Aug 28,2015 07:58*
AusWitness - **Use shards of metal and nails, akhi.**

*Aug 28,2015 07:58*
CHS - **Ok I'll get a bunch of screws and stuff**

*Aug 28,2015 08:00*
AusWitness - **Broken glass would probably work too. Just put as much sharp stuff as you can in there.**

*Aug 28,2015 08:00*
CHS - **Have you made these before? How far away do I have to get to be safe?? l'm thinking of filming and shouting allahu ahkbar right before it goes off**

*Aug 28,2015 08:02*
AusWitness - **I haven't made one before, but I've studied how to make them. Get FAR away from the bomb, brother. There's going to be chaos when it goes off . Shrapnel, blood, and panicking kuffar will be everwhere.**

*Aug 28,2015 08:02*
CHS - **Subhanallah**

*Aug 28,2015 08:03*
CHS - **We will put the video online and the muiahideen will be heroes** 

*Aug 28,2015 08:04*
AusWitness - **lf you can, dip the screws and other shraPnel in rat Poison before Putting them in. That way, the kuffar who get hit by them will be more likely to die.**

*Aug 28,2015 08:04*
AusWitness - **Indeed, akhi. The kuffar will speak our names with tenor in their voices.**
