Salaam, akhi. This is Australi Witness. I need your help with
something, brother.

*From AusWitness To Butayn*
Thank you, brother. For the past several months, I have been
coordinating an act of jihad with a mujahid who lives in Melbourne.
He sold bis car to buy a gun, but be basn't carried out the attack yet because he wants to make a video message to the kuffar with a black shahada flag, and he also wants his friend to participate in the attack with him. However, I haven't heard anything from him since July 24th. I have tried messaging him on Surespot, DMing him on Twitter, and emailing him, but he won't respond. I am very worried that he may have been captured by the kuffar. What should l do, akhi?

Brother, are you still there? Did you receive my message?

**8/12/15 3:09 AM** 

*From Butayn to AusWitness*

Yes I received it and the best thing I can tell you to do is be patient

**8/12/12 3:19 AM**

*From AusWitness To Butayn*
Well, the thing is, I am very afraid that something may have happened to him. He seems to have completely disappeared. We were very close to carrying out this attack, but now he's gone and I cannot contact him.

*From Butayn to AusWitness*

I don't know how to help you akhi

**8/12/15 3:20 AM** 

*From Butayn to AusWitness* 

If he's been caught then we must ask Allah to free him

**8/12/15 3:27 AM** 

*From AusWitness To Butayn*

 If the kuffar captured him, it would be ail over the news, wouldn't it?

**8/12/15 3:36 AM** 

*From Butayn to AusWitness*  

Y es I think so

**8/20/15 8:09 AM** 

*From AusWitness To Butayn* 

Akhi, I need instructions on how to make pressure cooker bombs. Do you know where I can find any?

**8/24/15 1:01 PM** 

*From AusWitness to abUqba*

Salaam, akhi. What's up?

**8/24/15 10:16 PM** 

*From AusWitness to abUqba*

Who asked about me, brother?

**8/25/15 5:58 AM** 

*From AusWitness to abUqba*
Akhi, can you tell greenbirddawlah that l'm a trusted mujahid? He
keeps doubting my validity, so heâ€™s asking other mujahideen about me.

**8/25/15 6:30 AM**

*From AusWitness to abUqba*

An Australian brother. He said he asked you about me.

**8/25/15 8:12 AM**

*From AusWitness to abUqba*

Are you sure, akhi?

**8/27/15 2:08 AM** 

*From AusWitness to abUqba*

You were right, brother. He's accusing me of being a liar pretending to be a mujahid. I think he is trying to sabotage me.

**8/30/15 3:59 AM**

*From Butayn to AusWitness*

You know I don't trust you right?

**8/30/15 4:27 AM** 

*From AusWitness To Butayn* 

Why do you not trust me?
