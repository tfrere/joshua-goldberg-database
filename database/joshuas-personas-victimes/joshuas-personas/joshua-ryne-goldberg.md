[Internet troll Joshua Goldberg posed online as an ISIS Jihadist on twitter and as a white supremacist on reddit and the Daily Stormer. His trolling was so extreme that he earned a reputation in Jihadist circles, and inspired multiple radicalized Muslim teens to carry out terrorist attacks.](https://i.redd.it/71nhaui0aoca1.jpg)

Thus far, Goldberg’s case hasn’t gone before a grand jury. In December, a federal judge declared him [not competent to stand trial](https://web.archive.org/web/20160624034208/http://www.newsherald.com/article/20151214/NEWS/151219618) after an initial one-month mental health evaluation. Dr. Lisa Feldman, the forensic psychiatrist who evaluated him, testified that he showed signs of a disorder “on the schizophrenia spectrum” and harbored “very paranoid, suspicious ideas and a feeling that other people wanted to harm him.” In her judgment, he wasn’t fit to participate in his own defense.

Goldberg was [ordered to undergo](https://web.archive.org/web/20160624034208/http://www.newsherald.com/article/20151214/NEWS/151219618) a second, longer evaluation — four months, this time — to determine his mental state now and whether he was sane at the time of his alleged offense.

Goldberg’s attorney, Paul Shorstein, tells me over the phone that even if Goldberg’s online presence read as typical troll, not mentally unstable, that doesn’t mean he’s competent to stand trial. There are defendants, Shorstein said, who “may be normal in some sense,” but their brains don’t function in such a way that they’re able to understand and assist in a complex criminal defense.

For example, the defendant could appear not to understand the legal situation he’s gotten himself into, which Feldman felt was the case with Goldberg.

His [psychiatric evaluation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160624034208/http://media.news4jax.com/document_dev/2016/01/25/Goldberg%20competency%20report_1916697_ver1.0.pdf), released through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by several news organizations, describes him as suffering from “grandiosity” and “delusions of persecution.”

If Goldberg is later found competent and the case does go to trial, law blogger Ken White of Popehat [doesn’t like his chances](https://web.archive.org/web/20160624034208/https://popehat.com/2015/09/15/lawsplainer-whats-going-on-with-that-troll-joshua-goldberg-anyway/). White argues Goldberg had a viable defense, but threw it away through his own statements when he was arrested.

“Goldberg could have engaged in the troll’s typical defense — that he knew that [the FBI’s source] wasn’t a real terrorist and was stringing him along. I wouldn’t want to go to a jury with that, but it’s colorable,” White [wrote](https://web.archive.org/web/20160624034208/https://popehat.com/2015/09/15/lawsplainer-whats-going-on-with-that-troll-joshua-goldberg-anyway/). “But Goldberg blew that defense by talking to the FBI when they raided his house.”
