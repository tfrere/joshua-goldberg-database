à propos d’un article : 

> *[National Review](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/National_Review)*
's Charles Cooke described the article that Taranto responded to as "exquisite satire", [while](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Joshua_Ryne_Goldberg#cite_note-wsjGoldbergVariations-33) [Mike Masnick](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mike_Masnick)
 of [Techdirt](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Techdirt)
 called it "damn good satire, because it's just stupid enough at the beginning to drag you in and make you believe it, and then, slowly but surely, over the course of a very long writeup, it starts tossing out ever more ridiculous ideas -- drip... drip... drip -- that just, gently, turn up the outrage-o-meter, such that many people don't even realize that it's satire." [This persona was linked to Goldberg on](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Joshua_Ryne_Goldberg#cite_note-34) [Facebook](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Facebook)

> Before moving to the United States to work with human rights organisations there (because, let’s face it: the US needs human rights activism *far*
 more than Australia does), I worked for many of the most prominent human rights and civil liberties groups in Australia, including Amnesty International Australia, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, the Human Rights Working Group of the Greens NSW, and the Human Rights Law Centre. As a human rights activist and a civil libertarian, I’ve dedicated my life to protecting and promoting human rights and civil liberties, not only in Australia, but around the world. One of the things that I remember most fondly was my experience with the Human Rights Law Centre, which is an organisation dedicated to – in its own words – “freedom, respect, equality, dignity”. While the Human Rights Law Centre always defends legitimate freedom of speech and assembly (for example, the Human Rights Law Centre campaigned against Victoria’s draconian anti-protest laws which were intended to stop progressive protests from taking place), the organisation has worked diligently to expand legal protections against hate speech in Australia and to vigorously prosecute anyone expressing hateful or anti-human rights sentiments. And, in one particularly memorable case, the Human Rights Law Centre campaigned successfully to have anti-abortion protests banned in Australia.
