à propos de l’attaque au texas :

> doc FBI
> 
> 
> I reviewed open sourcel news articles describing the attack at the
> "Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest" on May 3,2015 in Garland, Texas. Based on this
> review I learned that on May 3,2015 the "Muhammad Art Exhibit and contest" was held
> at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas. During the event, two armed gunmen, in
> a dark-colored sedan, approached a police patrol car that had blocked their entrance to
> the event. The two gunmen, later identified as Elton Simpson and Nadir Hamid Soofi,
> stopped their sedan, stepped from their vehicle and opened fire on a police officer and a
> security officer, using the back of the car as cover. Elton Simpson and Nadir Hamid
> Soofi wore body armor and fired assault rifles at the officers. Police officers shot and
> killed both men. Following the attack, the lslamic State of lraq and the Levant (lSlL) also
> known as the lslamic State of lraq and Syria (lSlS) claimed responsibility for the attack in its news bulletin. lSlL identified the two gunman as "two soldiers from the soldiers of the Caliphate."
> 
> l also reviewed open source reports from Australian and UK media outlets
> that discussed the Garland, Texas attack. Based on my review, I determined that prior
> to the attack, Twitter user "Aushali Witness" posted tweets calling for an attack on the
> Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest in Garland, Texas. The media outlets also reported
> that Twitter user "Aushali Witness" posted a map of the Curtis Culwell Center prior to
> the attack and urged anyone in the area to attack "with your weapons, bombs, or
> knives."
> 
> I reviewed open source documents that showed communication from
> Twitter user "Australi Witness" in reference to the Garland, Texas attack. Based on my
> review I determined that on or about May 3,2015, Twitter user "Australi Witness" used
> Twitter screen name "@AusWitness3" to tweet, 'l'M BACK KUFFAR! DIE lN YOUR
> RAGEI" On the morning of the attack in Garland, Texas, attacker Elton simpson, using
> Twitter handle @atawaakul with screen name "shariah is Light" retweeted the "Australi
> witness" message. Based on my training and experience, I know that "kuffar" is an
> Arabic term that refers to non-Muslims or non-believers and that the term is used by
> lslamic extremists as a derogatory term for non-Muslims.
