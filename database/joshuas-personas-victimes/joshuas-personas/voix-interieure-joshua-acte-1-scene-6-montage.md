# Acte I - Scène 6 : Journal intime de Joshua

My name is Joshua Ryne Goldberg. 

I was born on May 14, 1995 in Jacksonville, Florida, which is where I lived until my family eventually moved to the nearby suburb of Orange Park. 

From my childhood until 2015, I was the most prolific troll in the history of the internet, being involved in a dizzying array of dramas and controversies on the web and essentially acting as a nihilistic chaos agent, taking multiple sides on every single issue under a staggering number of fake identities.

Trollin ain’t easy, but somebody’s gotta do it. 

In 2015, I was arrested in a high-profile terrorism case due to my bogus  “Australi Witness” jihadist persona, where I purported to be a Lebanese-Australian ISIS supporter. 

I have clinical depression, but I suppose my depression manifests itself as extreme apathy. 

I completely lack emotion and really couldn't care less about much of anything. I could act "normal" if I wanted to, but why should I change myself to seek the approval of others? Hell, I don't even WANT the approval of others.

I don't go around telling people that I have aspergers syndrome, and I certainly don't use it as an excuse to be an as*hole.

*Dear Therapists, Psychologists, and Other Assorted Quacks,*

*You're so predictable.*

*Sincerely, Metropolis*

If You Experience An Emotion In A Dream… that you've never experienced in real life…

Would you consider it a real emotion that you are capable of feeling in real life, or just something that your subconscious mind created, that has no basis in reality? Do you think it would be possible to feel an entirely new emotion in a dream; one that no one has ever felt - or could possibly feel - in real life?

Autistics feel emotion strongly? Sorry, but that's a load of crap.

I am literally not capable of having fun. Seriously.

I don't want any friends. 

I don't connect with people. 

The more I see of people, the more I hate them. 

The chances of me ever maintaining a friendship are pretty much zero.

Even if I like someone, there is pretty much a 99% chance that I will end up disliking them at some point, for whatever reason. 

And, even if I still like them, I don't ever want to see someone again after I see them once.

I hate everyone. 

I cannot cry. No matter how hard I attempt to make myself cry, I simply cannot do it. I am far too apathetic and emotionless.

To be honest, I don’t really take pleasure in anything.

I am constantly wishing that some kind of devastating force would wipe all of them off the face of the earth. 

Whatever will cause chaos.

I don't really even know what I want. 

I want, but I don't want. 

I feel, but I don't feel. I am a mess.

I have no idea what I “really” am. I can’t just “be myself”, because I have no idea who “myself” really is.

And I can analyze fictional characters, but I can’t analyze myself, so I suppose that I sort of have to turn myself into a fictional character (or numerous fictional characters) in order for things to make sense to me. 

I have no real sense of self or any real self-identity.
