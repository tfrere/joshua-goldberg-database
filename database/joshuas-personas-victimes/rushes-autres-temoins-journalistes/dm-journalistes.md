</aside>

**ELISE POTAKA**

We meet again!

*Apr 15*

Can I ask u something?

*Apr 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I suppose so.

*Apr 15*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Was it you on Facebook the other day? I‚Äôm not out to judge

Just curious

*Apr 15*

Maybe I got it wrong?

But yr anti ISIS right?

*Apr 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Yes, it was me on Facebook pretending to be you. And yes, I am anti-ISIS.

*Apr 15*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Ok. Can I ask what‚Äôs yr interest in Junaid Thorne?

*Apr 15*

Aren‚Äôt u in the US?

*Apr 15*

I should say I‚Äôm not friends with Junaid, have just interviewed him before

*Apr 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I am interested ub extremist movements. Also, I gathered some information from Junaid‚Äôs followers.

They are planning a Charlie Hebdo-style attack on Australian cartoonists Bill Leak and Larry Pickering.

They have the addresses of both cartoonists.

*Apr 15*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Sorry I was just sleeping. They told u they want to carry out an attack?

Have u told relevant authorities in Australia?

*Apr 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

No, I haven‚Äôt told any authorities about it. I live in the US.

*Apr 16*

**ELISE POTAKA**

How serious did they sound in terms of targeting Leak and Pickering? Or was it just roundabout talk

Can I ask, how did u instigate those conversations with them?

*Apr 16*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I can send you some screenshots via email if you‚Äôd like me to.

But, first, you have to tell Junaid that I had nothing to do with the Twitter account & that you made a mistake.

*Apr 16*

![20150415-2.PNG](DM%20Journalistes%20f8d9d62bdbd740d58c090c5ad84a8ba2/20150415-2.png)

**ELISE POTAKA**

Can I ask, what do u hope to do with all the info u get?

*Apr 16*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Another journalist asked me for the info to use as part of a story, so I emailed it to him.

*Apr 16*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Oh ok.

Aussie?

*Apr 16*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Yes.

*Apr 16*

![20150416.PNG](DM%20Journalistes%20f8d9d62bdbd740d58c090c5ad84a8ba2/20150416.png)

Listen, if you can convince Junaid not to send his jihadist buddies after me. I can send you the info too.

*Apr 16*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Has anyone threatened u?

*Apr 16*

Can u send me screengrab of grant Taylor talking about me?

*Apr 16*

Btw I‚Äôve also worked for BBC, DW, SBS, ABC, Sydney morning herald, global mail, Agence France Presse

*Apr 16*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Not yet, but I fully expect to start receiving threats.

And I think he would get mad at me if I did, I don‚Äôt want to start flights.

*Apr 16*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Tbh I think Junaid is someone who just influences through words, not sure he would really bother, or be organised enough, to do anything

That‚Äôs just my reading of him

*Apr 16*

My email address is elise.potakaosborne@gmail.com

Hope u can also send me the grabs

*Apr 16*

*Dear Ms. Potaka,*

*Here is some information that I gathered about Junaid Thorne‚Äôs followers.*

*Most of these screenshots were taken a while ago, and most of the accounts have since been suspended (ISIS accounts are CONSTANTLY suspended and then re-created).*

*As you read these screenshots, please keep in mind that I had to keep in character and act like I approved of what they were saying.*

*http://i.imgur.com/opP1Azu.png*

*Some of the info that I wasn‚Äôt able to screenshot includes:*

*Some of them shared this link (which, ironically, is a neo-Nazi blog) and talked about car-bombing the place : [https://cj303addict.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/almost-all-zionist-organizations-in-australia-are-located-on-one-street/](https://cj303addict.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/almost-all-zionist-organizations-in-australia-are-located-on-one-street/) (a user called @BasimaFaysal managed to screenshot one person sharing this link, but he didn‚Äôt screenshot the car-bombing discussion)*

*Some of them talked about the Reclaim Australia rallies and suggested attacking it, but others said that it would be a waste of time because the people at the rally are all ‚Äústupid junkies‚Äù and ‚Äúdrunk bogans‚Äù.*

*A ton of them praised the Lindt Cafe attack and promised that there would be more just like it.*

*Keep in mind, the screenshots here are only a TINY fraction of the interactions that I‚Äôve had with ISIS supporters on Twitter. There was much, MUCH more. But, again, you pretty much have to screenshot all of this stuff immediately, because ISIS accounts are taken down at a rapid pace.*

*Overall, it‚Äôs pretty stunning how many of them claimed to be connected with the Human Rights Law Center (@rightsagenda) and/or Amnesty International.*

**GRANT TAYLOR**

Hello again. I had a quick chat with the Aust Fed Police this morning who would also be very keen to see any material you can pass on.

Sorry if i‚Äôm sounding a bit pushy, but any chance of seeing the Leak and Pickering stuff today? And what time is it there? 10.30am here

*Apr 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I sent you the email. Did you receive it?

*Apr 16*

**GRANT TAYLOR**

I have. Just going thru now but what I have seen looks amazing. You actually got people to admit they were planning jihad. brilliant.

Go to bed and will send you a decent message tonight. Ta

*Apr 16*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Thanks! I wish I could have taken more screenshots, but I‚Äôm glad that what I saved was good enough. I look forward to hearing back from you!

Hey‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt heard back from you. Any updates?

The Hasan Ali IS guy was talking to a Reclaim Australia supporter (since suspended as well) when he said he would conquer Australia.

Can I ask why you didn‚Äôt mention how the jihadists discussed Amnesty International & the Human Rights Law Centre?

*Apr 18*

**GRANT TAYLOR**

Bugger. I thought I read that straight off the post. The issue was room - it‚Äôs hard to work out sometimes what to leave out. Otherwise ok?

*Apr 18*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Yep. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs alright otherwise. Can you edit the article?

*Apr 18*

**GRAN TAYLOR**

I can. Will get it changed now

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I‚Äôve also found other posts on other sites talking about attacking Leak&Pickering.

To **grant.taylor@wanews.com.au**

*Dear Mr. Taylor,*

*I frequently persude Islamic extremist communities (along with neo-Nazi communities) and I have noticed some chatter on both of them about having Bill Leak and Larry pickering killed.*

*Here, we have someone on 4chan‚Äôs /pol/ (a popular neo-Nazi* *hangout) encouraging people to contact radical Islamic groups in Australia in order to have them kill the cartoonists, which would then ‚Äúincrease nationalism‚Äù : http//archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/43817729/*

*The flags next to each post show which country the poster is from. This thread was apaprently posted by someone from Greenland.*

*That thread was posted numerous times, and it was also posted on 8chan several times as well. I‚Äôve seen a new version of the thread posted almost every day. For example, it was also posted as a response to this thread : [https://archive.today/UPVSb](https://archive.today/UPVSb) (you have to scroll  down quite a lot to find it)*

*There was a thread on Islamic Awakening about Bill Leak, but that site is down at the moment.*

*As for the article that you wrote, it should be updated.*

*It wasn‚Äôt IslamicStateAU who said that they were gonna have Leak and Pickering killed. It was someone called ShamiWitness. There ‚ÄúShamiWitness‚Äù, as a quick search reveals.*

*The Hasan Ali IS guy was talking to a Reclaim Australia supporter named Nathan Sykes (since suspended as well) when he said that he would conquer Australia.*

*You should also DEFINITELY mention the connections with Amnesty International Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre. That‚Äôs very important information.*

Object : Junaid Thorne Information 

*Dear Mr.Minear,*

*Recently, I set up a fake account under the name Junaid Thorne, impersonating the Perth-based Islamic radical preacher (https://twitter.com/JunaidThorne). Immediately, Australian jihadists began to follow me and engage in conversations with me.*

*The real Junaid Thorne eventually caught on and set up a real account for himself (https://twitter.com/MJunaidThorne1).

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Are you still there?

*Aprl 20*

**GRANT TAYLOR**

Yeah sorry, been a bit crook last couple of days. I have forwarded it to AFP.

Did you detect a note of sarcasm in the original neoNazi post?

It is hard to tell if they are being serious or joking. No doubt the ithough that dea spread pretty quickly to others who may not have seen

the joke. not really sure what to male of it to be honest. You? 

*Apr 20*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

To be honest, if it were a joke, I don‚Äôt think they would have posted it so many times & included links to real Islamic extremist groups.

The same post was made over and over and over again, all of them by someone from Greenland.

If it were a joke, I don‚Äôt see why they would be so eager to repost it‚Ä¶ unless they actually did want people to carry out the instructions.

Do you plan to update the article, though?

I mean, to fix the error and to add the information about the jihadists working with ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù groups.

*Apr 20*

**GRANT TAYLOR**

I did ask for it to be changed but it had already been replaced on the website by the terror raids in Melbourne. Again junaid links.

You are probably right re the Neo nazi post. The intent is clearly to plant a seed in someone‚Äôs head.

*Apr 20*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I‚Äôm still having discussions with jihadists on the account. Can I send you some more info so you can write a new article‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and include the info about ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù groups in it?

There‚Äôs an Aussie jihadist I‚Äôm talking to right now who is providing me with all sorts of ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù info.

Aside from the planned attacks on Leak&Pickening, there‚Äôs been some chatter about attacking Anzac Day parades, esp. in Sydney & Melbourne.

*Dear Ms.Pooley*

*I frequently peruse Islamic extremist communities (along with neo-Nazi communities) and I have noticed some chatter on both of them about having Bill Leak and Larry Pickering killed.*

*Here, we have someone on 4chan‚Äôs /pol/ (a popular neo-Nazi hangout) encouraging people to contact radical Islamic groups in Australia in order to have them kill the cartoonists, which would then ‚Äúincrease nationalism‚Äù : http//archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/43817729/*

*The flags next to each post show which country the poster is from. This thread was apaprently posted by someone from Greenland.*

*That thread was posted numerous times, and it was also posted on 8chan several times as well. I‚Äôve seen a new version of the thread posted almost every day. For example, it was also posted as a response to this thread : [https://archive.today/UPVSb](https://archive.today/UPVSb) (you have to scroll down at the moment.*

*The West Australian also forgot to include the information about jihadist ties to Amnesty International Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre. That‚Äôs some of the most shocking information I uncovered, and it definitely needs to be reported on.*

Object : Junaid Thorne Information (12)

*Dear Mr.Minear,*

*Recently, I set up a fake account under the name Junaid Thorne, impersonating the Perth-based Islamic radical preacher (https://twitter.com/JunaidThorne). Immediately, Australian jihadists began to follow me and engage in conversations with me.*

*The real Junaid Thorne eventually caught on and set up a real account for himself (https://twitter.com/MJunaidThorne1). However, by impersonating Junaid, I was able to extract some very interesting information from his followers when they thought I was him. In particular, I learned that jihadists in Australia are planning to attack cartoonists Bill Leak and Larry Pickering, both of whom drew cartoons poking fun at Muhammed.*

*Here is some information that I gathered about Junaid Thorne‚Äôs followers.*

*Most of these screenshots were taken a while ago, and most of the accounts have since been suspended (ISIS accounts are CONSTANTLY suspended and then re-created).*

*As you read these screenshots, please keep in mind that I had to keep in character and act like I approved of what they were saying.*

He‚Äôd probably just respond with something about Twitter being run by kuffar.

BTW, if ISIS attacks London, it will probably be today.

Friday is the day when the largest amount of Muslims are praying in mosques. Today would be the day that ISIS would shoot up a mail.

They‚Äôve been threatening to do it all week with their #LondonAttack Tweets.

*May 15*

It could just be keyboard warrior bullshit, but those threats were much more specific than the usual ‚Äúhurka we will kill the infidels‚Äù

Two of them posted pictures of their guns and bombs for an imminent London attack, and some others talked about attacking a shopping mall.

*May 15*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Why would they do Friday? That‚Äôs the least likely day surely

Given prayers etc

*May 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Because that‚Äôs the day when the most amount of Muslims are praying, so, in a shooting, they‚Äôd kill the most non-Muslims & the least Muslims.

Oh I see. Yeah possibly a good point

But already past prayer time no?

Hey, can you get any Australian media outlets to report on this? washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/‚Ä¶

*May 29*

Make sure they include the part where the local Islamic leader says this :

‚ÄúEverybody has a right to be a bigot. Everybody has a right to be a racist. Everybody has a right to be an idiot.‚Äù

Australians would be absolutely stunned by a minority person saying that.
