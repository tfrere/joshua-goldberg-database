He promoted an illusory friendship between *Australi Witness* (his pro-[ISIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant) Twitter account) and Veiszadeh, with the objective of smearing Veiszadeh's reputation.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariam_Veiszadeh#cite_note-10) Under the name "Michael Slay", Goldberg wrote the majority of articles on *[The Daily Stormer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Stormer)* criticising Veiszadeh, including the initial piece criticising her stance on a shirt, sold by [Woolworths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Group_(Australia)), that read 'If You Don't Love It Leave'. Upon learning the true identity of the writer, website owner [Andrew Anglin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Anglin) removed all content by Goldberg
