OBSERVATION CAMILLE: INVENTION DE DIALOGUE
Procès: I told him that I'm going to see how close I can
get. That basically I'm going in. And I conveyed to him that I was terminating our conversation. I used the capital letters at the bottom.
That's the standard way for terminating a conversation. So
he knew that that was going to be the last time he was going
to hear from me at the conclusion of that conversation.
