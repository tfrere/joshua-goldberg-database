Procès: before I physically moved, I called my
point of contact, again, who was the task force officer,
Garland Police Department officer assigned to the FBI.
And I asked for his permission if I could leave my
place, do a drive by of the convention center and take
pictures of it as I was driving, which I could later use for
future conversations.
