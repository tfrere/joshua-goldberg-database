"Okay, you'd like to talk to us? We appreciate, it will help clear some things up, but it’s
also important that while you're talking to us, that you tell the truth.",Jim Berry,gold,,
Yes.,Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
" What I want to know first, is that you mentioned that you were on some
medication.",Jim Berry,gold,,
"I was taking med; I'm taking medicine, Fetzima for depression, and Clonodine
for insomnia and then non-prescription is melatonin for insomnia and Prevacid
for my stomach problems.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
,ELIPSE,,,
"Okay, so you stay up normally all night?
What do you do when you're up?",Campbell,"double gold, gold",,
My classes and watch TV.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
Classes and TV? Anything else?,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
Surf the internet.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"Okay, Twitter and Facebook? Anything else?",Jim Berry,,,
"T used to go on 4chan, but I don’t really anymore, except to read it, I don’t post
there anymore.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"I'would go on the pool board and talk about political stuff,
I would just post random stuff to get a reaction a lot of the times.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Okay. Now talk to me more about these, you said that you would post
stuff to get, you know, sort of a rise out of other people. I think you
said it was 4chan. do you still do that?",Jim Berry,,,
"Um, no I don’t anymore, I just read it.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Okay, why do you think all this happened this morning?",Campbell,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
"I don’t know, I guess something to do with someone connecting to my IP
address.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
"Okay. Now you're sure about that? You're sure you're not doing anything still to
incite people? Or to do things on the internet?",Jim Berry,,,
No I’m not. Not anymore.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
Not anymore...and what were you doing before?,Jim Berry,,,
"Well, I would just post random stuff just to see what the reaction
would be.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"I think that, that was the sort of stuff, like; people would post
threads about certain things and then I would respond ",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"You're nervous, I understand that, and I also think that you're not being completely honest about all your online activity. I think you’re posting more things in that, you know, to excite
people than you're telling us about and you’ve done it more recently than you're
being honest about.",Jim Berry,gold,,
"Well like what, can you tell me you’re accusing me of, please?",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"No, you tell me,",Jim Berry,,,
I don’t know what you're accusing me of.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Okay.  Let me ask you this, do you have any connection to
Australia?",Jim Berry,,,
"No...no, I don’t have any connection to Australia, I was born here.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
Have you posted anything about Australia at all?,Jim Berry,,,
I wrote some articles for a site talking about Australia.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
What site was it?,Jim Berry,,,
Thought catalogue. It was talking about freedom of speech in Australia.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Anything else? Any other postings, any other websites?",Jim Berry,,,
Huh?,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Okay. Um, I'm just gonna show you something real quick, okay?",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
What do you think about that?,Campbell,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
It’s talking about Kansas City; I don’t live in Kansas City.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
Is that you?,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
"Is that me, who?",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
" Be honest man, the best thing you can do is be honest, if you lie, then you're really going to get in.  You just tell us what you're doing, explain to me so I can understand what all of that is about. Do we have a problem? So tell me about that, just tell me about it... Josh, Joshua?",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
Yeah?,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
You still with me?,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
"It’s okay to make mistakes, we all do, the thing is you got to own up to them.
We can work with you, and keep talking if you own up to it.",Jim Berry,gold,,
"The thing is, you wouldn’t believe me if I told you the truth.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
Try us; all we’re asking for is the truth.,Campbell,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
"Alright, for a long time, I’ve wanted to kill myself, I've been thinking of
different ways to do it. I just don’t care what happens to me anymore. So, uh, I m gonna go online, I'm gonna pretend to be, I dunno, ISIS, or whatever, and I'm gonna have the FBI come
and shoot me or something like that.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, travailler, triplegold",,
"So, it concerns us that you talked about killing yourself, that’s not
something that is a good thing or a healthy thing, obviously, so, I mean, you still
have those thoughts?",Jim Berry,gold,,
but I don’t have the guts.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
You don’t have the guts?,Jim Berry,,,
"then my other thought was at the last moment I'm gonna go online and talk to these people and file an anonymous police report
about it and then I’m gonna write articles about it and be a real journalist.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, travailler",,
"Okay, so the stuff that we're referring to, the, all the ISIS, you know…",Jim Berry,gold,,
Obviously I’m not actually a member of ISIS or have anything to do with them.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Well I don’t, you, I, I realize you say obviously, but it's not obvious to us, okay?
So that’s what we have to work through, okay? So, you know, you may think that
but, you know, I’m not sure who you're talking to, I'm not sure if we have a real
problem out there because, you know, some of the stuff that you're putting
online. ",Jim Berry,,,
"I didn’t think any of these people were, what I was gonna do is I
was actually going to, to get these people to tell me that they were gonna do stuff
and then I was gonna report them to the police. And I know that you think I'm
full of shit, but that is really what I was gonna do.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
I always thought I would just be some kind of vigilante.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, travailler",,
"You weren't concerned that maybe one of these people would carry out an act
and hurt people before you had a chance to stop it?",Campbell,,,
"Well that’s why I gave them a date to do it on so that I could; I could report it
before then.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"So, how many, Kansas City, are there, are there others that are you talking to, and whatever so, however you were talking, I don’t know, was it Twitter? I mean, what were you using?",Campbell,,,
It was Surespot.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Okay, so who were you talking to?",Jim Berry,gold,,
Random people who added me.,Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"I set up this fake Twitter account claiming to be some jihadist from
Australia and told people to add me.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
And what username do you use when you do that Twitter?,Campbell,"double gold, gold",,
the Twitter accounts are banned.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"But what were, what username were you using when you were doing that?",Jim Berry,,,
It was called AustraliWitness.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"Okay, so it’s important for us now to know, how many people, who are they, you
know, when I say people, I mean you may not have met them face to face but,
you know, you're conversing with somebody online, so, I mean, do you have a
lot of, what would they be called, um, like, you know on Facebook you have
friends, mean, what, what are they called? Um, how many people are you
talking to about acts, similar to the Kansas attack?",Jim Berry,,,
There weren’t very many people. 14.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"There, there was at least one person who told me that something, there, there, I
think it was the one guy who's, one guy who told me that something was gonna
happen in the UK and that something else was gonna happen, but he really didn’t
give me any more details.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
Do you remember what username that person used?,Jim Berry,,,
"First it was JihadiUK, then he deleted that, then it was just Jihadi.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"so are there other usernames or, that you're in contact with?",Jim Berry,,,
"There were a few but I wasn’t really talking to them that much, although most of
them, most of the time they would, they knew I was fake, I mean they would ask
me to prove that I was real and I wouldn’t be able to, so they would just, you
know, Allah will punish you or whatever.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
Okay,Jim Berry,,,
"But you know, I, I’ve written for a few websites as a journalist and or at least as a
blogger and I was gonna report on them, what was going on cause I
didn’t think there was any other way I could ever get a job unless I did something
like that, became a journalist and L...you know.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Okay, uh, so really what we need to know, like I said before, is, I mean, are you
doing that with other people? Are there other, you know, people that you're
talking about this similar? Are, you know, plotting attacks with anybody else?
",Jim Berry,,,
"I wasn’t seriously plotting attacks with, what I was telling you was, first off, I
didn’t even think these people were even real, I thought they were people like
me, you know, and, or, or a journalist that are trying to uncover...
you know, going undercover or stuff like that or, uh, FBI agents and...I told them
I was going to do stuff to try to get them to believe that I was real. I talked to them that I was going to attack Perth, Australia, which obviously I can’t since I live here.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
‘What were you going to do in Perth?,Campbell,,,
I was going to shoot a bunch of kuffar.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
So there's no one else?,Jim Berry,,,
"Well, there were other people who told me they were going to do stuff. Like, Jihadi...and uh, Mohamadmo. One who claims to be in Melbourne, Australia.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
And so what’s Mohamadmo up to?,Jim Berry,,,
"Going on to this s-s-s-se-site, claims he’s gonna go on a shooting.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Shooting, shooting what?",Jim Berry,,,
Kuffar.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"So when these people starting talking to you online about this, what do you
say back to them?",Campbell,gold,,
"That I’m gonna do the same thing. I screenshot the posts that they make and I
have at least three different screenshots on like on the laptop cause you know I
wanted to be a journalist ...at one point I wanted to be an FBI agent.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
Say that again.,Jim Berry,gold,,
"At one point I wanted to be an FBI agent. So I was like practicing going
undercover or whatever, trying to see if I could be really convincing but
obviously I wasn’t doing a very good job since most of the people didn’t believe
me.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"So he was gonna shoot kuffar, were you helping him with that, the idea?",Jim Berry,gold,,
"Yeah, I was trying to coax him into saying he was gonna do all this stuff.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
So you were coming up with the idea.,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
"Yeah, I was trying to coax these people into openly saying they
were gonna commit jihad so that I could screenshot it and then report them to the
police.  Even, I talked to this journalist, Grant Taylor, about it, got these
people to admit they were jihad, and I told him and he
wrote a story about it.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, triplegold",,
"Is that important to you? When, like when people write these stories about what you're doing? Does it, does it make you feel good, that it’s, you know, kinda what you're doing is in the news?",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"I don’t really feel good about anything, to be honest, I don’t really
experience pleasure.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, pause",,
"I mean it must give you some little bit of satisfaction in talking to these guys too,
you know, who are willing to listen to you and take your ideas and run with them
and actually, you know, go blow something up because you said, said so. | mean
that’s, not many people can influence people like that; it’s kind of a unique
characteristic. That’s gotta make you feel good a little bit.",Campbell,,,
"Well nobody actually blew anything up because of me. I mean...and I, I was
hoping nobody actually would.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"that’s a little confusing when, you know, obviously, I mean you have to believe we've done some homework because we’re here, right? So we know a little bit about you. Um, and of course,
and in some open source stuff you, uh, you've taken credit, I mean, what about
the Garland attacks?",Jim Berry,gold,,
"I didn’t actually encourage them to do anything really, I just, on
the AustraliWitness account I just posted about this, this was gonna be in Garland
and then these people who followed that account re-tweeted that so they gave my
fake account credit for it, credit for inspiring it, but I didn’t actually talk to those
people and I’m not lying here, I did not actually talk to those people. They
followed me and they saw that I posted about it and re-tweeted me and I think
they re-tweeted a few other people too.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Did, did you post an
article on the internet about the Garland attacks and your inspiration for that?",Jim Berry,,,
"Were you talking about that I posted as AustraliWitness that I that it was like I, that was what I would tell people, other jihadist people to try to convince them that I was real, but they
still didn’t believe it.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
Okay what about the justpasteit article?,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"At the beginning I said I think that you might know me for
inspiring the thing is I really don’t actually think I inspired that.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"My point is that that was a real attack and I know you're saying that you
didn’t think any of this was gonna happen, but we had a real attack
and you're taking credit for that. ",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"See the thing is that I didn’t actually talk to these
people or encourage them to attack, I didn’t even say on Twitter to
go attack this, I just said there’s going to be a kuffar going to hold a draw the
Prophet competition in Garland, Texas and then they re-tweeted that and
then later tried to attack and got shot.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"Okay, so you put that out there before the attack.",Jim Berry,gold,,
"I said kuffar are going to be holding this contest but a whole bunch of other
accounts were posting that too, so they had to have known about it.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
Okay. And you don’t feel any responsibility for that?,Jim Berry,gold,,
"Well no, because I don’t think that I actually had anything to do with it because
they already knew about the attack, they re-tweeted other, other posts about it.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Yeah, but the thing is, is that I told you, I was trying to get these
people to say they were going to do this so I could screen cap, but…",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"But if they didn’t really want anything to do with it, why would you continue to
try to convince them to do it?",Jim Berry,,,
" I just wanted to speak with them really, or just mess with them anyways.
I mean it just doesn’t make a lot of sense.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"So you're setting this up for potentially somebody to get killed?
For potentially a jihadist to maybe get killed by police.",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold, test",,
"Okay, let’s talk about Kansas City for a minute. What's what's going on
there, what do we have to worry about?",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"This guy said he wanted to carry out this attack so I said, uh, make a bomb and
he asked what kind of bomb and I suggested a pipe bomb, a pressure cooker
bomb, I think the pressure cooker bomb might have been his idea, but I, sent him
instructions on how to make one and he sent me pictures of the bomb, which I
screen capped and those are on my computer. I screencapped the stuff he sent
me and getting him admitting to this.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"So, you, you sent the instructions to him to make the bomb?",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
Yeah.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"You did? Okay. Um, where did you find those?",Jim Berry,gold,,
On the internet.,Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
Did you know how to make a bomb?,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"No, well obviously I just googled it.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, pause",,
Links regarding making bombs?,Jim Berry,,,
"Yeah, they're very easily available, just searching.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"And then, what did he do? You said, so did he make it
you said?",Jim Berry,gold,,
He was trying to and sent me pictures of his work in progress.,Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
When is this attack supposed to happen?,Jim Berry,gold,,
"September 13th, In Kansas City, Kansas City Stair Climb.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
Is that an event?,Jim Berry,,,
"Yeah, it’s this 9/11 memorial thing. He suggested attacking on it, well first off, at
the very beginning I asked him if there were going to be any attacks on 9/11 and
he said “no, but you should carry one out,” so I said, so I encouraged him to do
that and tried to coax him into sending me all this admissions that he was going
to carry a bombing out.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"You see how that can be kind of a problem for us, sitting on this side? You know,
you've been talking to somebody who's now gonna try to carry out an attack and
now we have to try to stop it.",Campbell,,,
"I was going to try to stop it from actually being carried out by sending the
information to the police. Like at the last minute and I thought the details that I'd posted about it online
were really accessible to the police so I figured they were already gonna stop it.
Cause if I actually wanted this stuff to happen, keep in mind, if I actually wanted
this stuff to happen, I would not have made so many posts explicitly telling what
exactly was going to happen. I would have kept it a secret. But the thing is, I
wanted these people to get caught, which is why I made so many posts giving
away their username and what their plans were, if I wanted this stuff to happen, I
would not have posted any of that.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"It just doesn’t make sense to me, you know, I mean you're
starting these things, you’re encouraging people, you're coming up with ideas,
you're providing the instructions and even if you posted, you're hoping that they
get caught or killed.",Jim Berry,gold,,
Yes.,Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"I, I didn’t really want this stuff to happen, what, my scenario was that this
guy, these guys get shot by police...and that there’s this big raid on them and it’s
in all the papers, that this terror plot was foiled.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
And you wanted to be able to take credit for the terror plot being foiled?,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"Well hopefully, so I could be a real journalist cause I don’t have any kind of job
really, my mom wants me to get jobs and she suggested journalism. I figured this
was the only way I could really be a journalist right now is to go undercover
online, cause, you know, I have all sorts of different fake personalities on the internet.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
Tell me about that.,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"Cause you know, I have all sorts of different fake personalities on the internet.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"One person Tonya Cohen, she is this radical, left-wing, social
justice activist from Australia who moved to the U.S. Ryoko Tamanda is a
Japanese woman involved in Libertarian politics who lives in Tokyo, Michael
Slay is a neo-Nazi who I, that was one of my most convincing ones because I
actually managed to get accepted onto a real bunch of, the most read neo-Nazi
site, the Daily Stormer, as Michael Slay and he really believed I was real.
But eventually, he kicked me off because, to create a story I posed as
another person from Australia, Josh Bornstein, and posted something on the
Times of Israel calling for Palestinians to be killed and then posted about that on
the Daily Stormer as Michael Slay and he didn’t want to get in trouble or get
sued or anything so he kicked me out, he kicked Michael Slay off. I mean, and
that’s not even half the personalities I created online.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, travailler",,
"Now are these, some of these are real people though, right?",Jim Berry,"gold, travailler",,
"The only real people I impersonated was Junaid Thorne, the radical Australian
Islamic preacher and Josh Bornstein, this Australian lawyer that I basically just
picked out at random.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold, questiobn, travailler",,
Do you ever post as yourself?,Campbell,"double gold, gold",,
I don’t really use my real name except on Facebook.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"what other, so when all of these other various names, I mean, what are
you posting? Like the Daily Stormer isn’t that sort of a, uh.",Jim Berry,,,
"The Daily Stormer is this ridiculous, it’s like this very trollish, neo-Nazi website
that’s gained infamy as like the most read neo-Nazi web forum, so I knew I gotta
infiltrate this to stir up trouble. So I was posing as this, this neo-Nazi whose
username on it was European88 and there were a whole bunch of other accounts
on Reddit too, but that was it, the main Michael Slay account and I noticed the
Daily Stormer was  I emailed the, the guy from the Daily Stormer asking if I
could be on that site because I was European88 and he said yes and let me on the
site so I was trying to write all this stuff for Daily Stormer that would stir up all
sorts of chaos on the internet.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
Seems to be kind of a common theme,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"Seeing people react with, obviously none of this stuff was sincere.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"And then I would also post as this, I would fight, I would have these
two accounts fight, have different accounts fight with each other, like
European88 would fight with EmilyAmericana.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"I was trying to turn everyone against everyone just because I could; it wasn’t
always negative stuff though.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
I mean why would you do that?,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"To see how people would respond to different things, I guess. I would sometimes
also post encouraging stuff to people, as different personas. I was just seeing how
people would respond to different things.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"I don’t, I don’t ever leave the house, so I mean, I guess I would just create all
these fake different people in this different world.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"So, so you don’t go out much, so you stay here and this is what you do, is create
all these people.",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
Yeah and AustraliWitness was just one of them.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"wait a minute, so, and it’s AustraliWitness who was providing somebody with the
instructions to make a bomb for this Kansas City, is that correct? ",Jim Berry,gold,,
Wilayahks.,Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"so, when you sent the attacks did you, or sent, I'm sorry, when
you sent the, um, the links, or the instructions, um, did you have follow-up conversations about additional stuff, like, um, additional encouragement,
additional things to do with the bomb?",Jim Berry,gold,,
"Yes, he would ask me all these different questions that I didn’t know the answers to.
Like what kind of shrapnel should I use. Uh, I think I told him to use nails...which I don’t actually think would be very
effective, I was trying to make it like deliberately dangerous so it would blow up in
his face. That obviously didn’t happen.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"You were trying to make it deliberately dangerous so it would blow up in his
face?",Jim Berry,gold,,
Yeah.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Okay, so the one Kansas City was gonna happen at, you said a stair climb event.",Jim Berry,,,
Yeah.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
The one in Australia is gonna happen where?,Jim Berry,,,
At a synagogue.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"I figured that would be a place a jihadist would attack, so I, would want to attack,
so I suggested that he should attack a synagogue so I could get him to agree to
that and screen cap it.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
What’s the name of it?,Jim Berry,,,
Kehilat Nitzam.,Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Okay. So, um, one of the things that would help us, and you know, looking
further into these attacks and further into who you were talking to, uh, is that if
we, if you voluntarily let us into your accounts and took over those accounts.
",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
Yeah,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
Do you understand what I'm saying?,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
Yeah.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"Okay, cause, I mean, you know, you mentioned earlier, you know, you don’t go
outside, this is, I think, this, I mean, this is kind of your contact with the outside
world, right?",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
Yes.,Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"so, I mean are you going be able to kind of not do these things?",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"I don’t know. I thought, just, my life is over obviously, so…",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"so let's talk again about AustraliWitness, okay? And so, again, you
know, again that’s, I know you said you talk to, put a lot of stuff online and
different personas, trying to get people excited but it’s, it’s these attacks that
we're really concerned about and seeing, trying to stop these attacks and, uh, try
to determine the issue that we have, right? Which is right now, you know, you
stated earlier that, you know, you were in contact with a gentleman who you, uh,
were working with to conduct an attack on 09/13 in Kansas City.",Jim Berry,,,
"You were, you said something about helping the, reporting it to the reporters or
police or something like that, was that your plan?",Jim Berry,,,
"That there was someone was going to attack, to bomb the Kansas City stair climb
on September 13% and that someone was going to carry out an attack in Australia
in September, in Melbourne, Australia, I think at Kehilat Nitzam synagogue on
September 13™ as well at 6.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Okay, do you, but do you understand, or did you understand that, you know, real
bad guy, real bomb, from the instructions you provided, you know, if he doesn’t
get caught, real people die.",Jim Berry,gold,,
"Well I didn’t even think it would get that far, it sort of got out of control.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"As it was getting out of control you were still encouraging him to move forward
with the plan?",Jim Berry,gold,,
"I sort of started to just, just tell him that you'll be a martyr whatever, 1 stopped
providing serious encouragement, more and more Allah. I still did encourage him but not to the same extent, I didn’t provide him
with links on how to do stuff or whatever, but, I still did, yes I did encourage him
because I had to keep up the personality I had created I couldn’t suddenly break
character.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
And how was he gonna get there?,Jim Berry,gold,,
"A bus he just decided on a bus and decided it was going to be a $40
Greyhound bus ticket,",Joshua Goldberg,,,
Did he know where to go?,Jim Berry,,,
I had provided him with a map.,Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"I guess I just thought there’s no way he could Ul, especially since I was planning
to post on 8chan exactly what he was going to do. I never got to do it, obviously,
but I had something written out. But I didn’t post it.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"What a horrible person I would be, I should never have thought I could do this. I
should've never messed around with these people because it’s not a game.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"And I'm not some vigilante or journalist or certainly not a future FBI agent who
goes undercover. I should never have done it.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
So you said that you had already written something up about the attack?,Campbell,gold,,
"I was prepared to post on 8chan about what was going to
happen because I had already posted about the Melbourne thing on 8chan and
had the guy’s screenshot of it with the guy’s username and everything.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"Did you not think about this? I mean, when you were doing all this stuff, you
were doing it for a while, you didn’t think there might be a negative consequence to the stuff that you were doing? I mean, these are bad guys you're making with
and you're helping them. I mean I know you’re a smart guy, you had to have put
that together that you could get into trouble for what you were doing.",Campbell,gold,,
"First I thought the guys were just trolls, I guess I thought if the FBI or whatever
came I would pretend I had a guy and that was how I would die cause I've
always, like I said, I’ve always wanted to kill myself, but I've never had the guts
to do it and I still don’t. So when you came, I just got on the floor like he said
and I wouldn’t want to hurt my family even though, obviously I already have, a
great deal.",Joshua Goldberg,gold,,
"Just for my own knowledge, since I'm curious personally about you, um, do you
follow Islam? At all? ",Jim Berry,,,
"Do you like the United States, you like America?",Campbell,,,
"Yes, I’ve always said in my articles.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
"well maybe even if you really didn’t want it to happen, was there maybe a piece
of you that maybe kind of wanted to see it happen to see what kind of power you
could really generate with your writing and pretending to be that person?",Campbell,,,
"I guess there was some kind of sick, morbid curiosity that would, what would
happen if this did, if this was carried out and I know I didn’t want it to happen
but I didn’t think about what if it happened and I guess I thought if this did
happen then I would, I would retire AustraliWitness for good.",Joshua Goldberg,,,

"I guess I’m just a little confused why you wouldn’t just, I mean, why, why repost
those somewhere? Why not just give it to the police? It doesn’t make much
sense, it’s almost like you're drawing more attention to them, which may
potentially give them more encouragement to do more things instead of the
opposite.",Campbell,,,
"Well, the, the Islamic State board on 8chan is entirely trolls, there are no real
Islamic State people on it.",Joshua Goldberg,,,
And you know that?,Campbell,,,
"Because look at it, I mean, people spam porn on there all day and like, you know,
like, the drawings of Muhammad having sex with pigs on there and stuff like
that, it’s not real Islamic State people on it. They wouldn't post on a place like
that to begin with, so, this is going out to an audience of trolls and right-wing and
neo-Nazi types and the journalists and police officers who will see the posts.",,,,

Are you okay?,Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,

"Was there something else you wanted to say? Real quick you wanted to say
something?",Jim Berry,"double gold, gold",,
"No, just thinking about what I'm gonna do. My family doesn’t have a lot of
money to be able to afford a good lawyer. It just doesn’t feel real. I guess I never
really see things as real, this whole world always felt like, like it’s a dream or
something. It’s hard to describe, I’m the only real person, everyone else is just
like a figment of my imagination. It’s something I think about all the time.",Joshua Goldberg,"double gold, gold",,
"Well, I mean, obviously it is real and unfortunately, you know, your actions bring
real consequences that could be really bad for other people.",Jim Berry,,,
