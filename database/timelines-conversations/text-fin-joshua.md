# text fin Joshua

Okay, why do you think all this happened this morning?

I don’t know, I guess something to do with someone connecting to my IP address.

Okay. Um, I'm just gonna show you something real quick, okay?

What do you think about that?

It’s talking about Kansas City; I don’t live in Kansas City.

Is that you?

Is that me, who?

Be honest man, the best thing you can do is be honest,
if you lie, then you're really going to get in. D[o](http://in.do/) we have a problem?
... Josh, Joshua?

Yeah?

You still with me?

The thing is, you wouldn’t believe me if I told you the truth.

Try us; all we’re asking for is the truth.

Alright, for a long time, I’ve wanted to kill myself, I've been thinking of different ways to do it.
So, uh, I m gonna go online, I'm gonna pretend to be, I dunno, ISIS, or whatever, and I'm gonna have the FBI come and shoot me or something like that, but I don’t have the guts.

So you were coming up with the idea.

Yes I set up this fake Twitter account claiming to be some jihadist from Australia and told people to add me.

And what username do you use when you do that Twitter?

It was called AustraliWitness.
I was trying to coax these people into openly saying they were gonna commit jihad so that I could screenshot it and then report them to the police.
Even, I talked to this journalist, Grant Taylor, about it, got these people to admit they were jihad, and I told him and he wrote a story about it.

Is that important to you? When people write these stories about what you're doing? Does it, does it make you feel good ?

I don’t really feel good about anything, to be honest, I don’t really experience pleasure.

Okay what about the video statement?

At the beginning I said I think that you might know me for inspiring the thing is I really don’t actually think I inspired that.

My point is that It was a real attack and I know you're saying that you didn’t think any of this was gonna happen, but we had a real attack and you're taking credit for that.

See the thing is that I didn’t actually talk to these people or encourage them to attack, I just said there’s going to be a kuffar going to hold a draw the Prophet competition and then they re-tweeted that and then later tried to attack and got shot.

So you're setting this up for potentially somebody to get killed?

For potentially a jihadist to maybe get killed by police.

Okay, let’s talk about Kansas City for a minute. What's what's going on there, what do we have to worry about?

There was a guy who contacted me on twitter, he said he wanted to carry out this attack so I said, uh, make a bomb and he asked what kind of bomb and I suggested a pipe bomb, a pressure cooker bomb,
I think the pressure cooker bomb might have been his idea, but I sent him instructions on how to make one and he sent me pictures of the bomb, which I screen capped and those are on my computer.
I screencapped the stuff he sent me and getting him admitting to this.

So you sent the instructions to him to make the bomb?

Yeah.

Did you know how to make a bomb?

No, well obviously I just googled it.

And you wanted to be able to take credit for the terror plot being foiled?

Well hopefully, I don’t have any kind of job really, my mom wants me to get jobs and she suggested journalism.
I figured this was the only way I could really be a journalist right now is to go undercover online, cause, you know, I have all sorts of different fake personalities on the internet.

Tell us about them.

One person Tonya Cohen, she is this radical, left-wing, social justice activist from Australia.
Ryoko Tamanda is a Japanese woman involved in Libertarian politics,
Madotsuki the dreamer - a film critic who discusses movies on IMDB.
Michael Slay is a neo-Nazi who was my most convincing ones because I actually managed to get accepted onto the most read neo-Nazi site, the Daily Stormer, as Michael Slay and he really believed I was real.
I mean, and that’s not even half the personalities I created to stir up all sorts of chaos on the internet.

Seems to be kind of a common theme.

And then I would also post as this, I would fight, I would have these two accounts fight, have different accounts fight with each other, like European88 would fight with EmilyAmericana.
I was trying to turn everyone against everyone just because I could; it wasn’t always negative stuff though.

So, I mean that doesn’t’ make sense, why would you do that?

To see how people would respond to different things, I guess.
I would sometimes also post encouraging stuff to people, as different personas.
I was just seeing how people would respond to different things.
I don’t ever leave the house, so I mean, I guess I would just create all these fake different people in this different world.

So, you don’t go out much, you stay here and this is what you do, is create all these people.

Yeah and AustraliWitness was just one of them.

Okay. So, um, one of the things that would help us, and you know,
looking further into these attacks and further into who you were talking to, uh, is that if we,
if you voluntarily let us into your accounts and took over those accounts.

Yeah

Do you understand what I'm saying?

Yeah.

Okay, cause, I mean, you know, you mentioned earlier that you don’t go outside, this is, I think, this, I mean, this is kind of your contact with the outside world, right?

Yes.

so, I mean are you going be able to kind of not do these things?

I don’t know. I thought, just, my life is over obviously, so…
Burp

Are you okay?

It’s ok

Was there something else you wanted to say?

No, just thinking about what I'm gonna do.
It just doesn’t feel real. It’s hard to describe, I’m the only real person, everyone else is just like a figment of my imagination.
I guess I never really see things as real, this whole world always felt like, like it’s a dream or something.
