# Akhi, I've been talking to wilayahks and he says you seem reluctant. Are you really committed to carrying this out with me, brother? Because it seems like you keep delaying it over and over again. We can't keep waiting, akhi. If we don't carry this out soon, the kuffar will find us. This jihad is the answer to all of our problems, brother. When we carry out this attack, we will be martyrs around the world, and the lslamic State mujahideen will speak of us as heroes. And, once we enter Jannah, all of our problems will cease to exist. We have nothing to lose, brother. Please - I am begging you, akhi - please commit to carrying this out with me either this Saturday or next Saturday.
