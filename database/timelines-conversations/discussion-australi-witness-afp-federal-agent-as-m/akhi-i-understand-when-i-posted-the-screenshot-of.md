# Akhi, I understand. When I posted the screenshot of our conversation, I forgot that your username showed up in ir. If I had seen your username in the picture, I never would have posted il. I understand why you were afraid, brother I am so sorry for posting that, and I’ll never do anything like that again. I hope you can forgive me, and I hope you are still willing to carry out. Allah's will with me.
