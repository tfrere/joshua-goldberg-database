# I have spent the last several weeks absolutely terrified for you, akhi. I even made a Facebook account
so I could ask other Melbourne brothers if they had heard anything from you. I was so scared that something had happened to you. You've been the only thing I could think about for
weeks. I was so worried that you had been captured by the kuftar.
