# Brother, i am so sorry I made that post when I thought the attack was going to happen in a few hours. When the attack didn't happen, i tried to delete the thread, but I couldn't. I didn’t link to your Twitter, I only included a screenshot of our conversations. At the time, I wanted to inspire other mujahideen. This was during a time when l thought that our attack was imminent and I wanted to leave a message behind that other mujahideen would see. It was very stupid of me. I should have asked you first akhi. Again, when I posted that,I thought we were about to attack.
