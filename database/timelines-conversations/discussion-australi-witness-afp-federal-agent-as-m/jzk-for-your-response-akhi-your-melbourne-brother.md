# Jzk for your response, akhi. Your Melbourne brother might be a good brother, but it sounds tome like
he doesn't really want to attack. If we pull off this attack together, it will already be the largest attack in
Australian history. We can't obsess over carrying out something "bigger'', because we don't have the resources to do that. We can't carry out something like 9/11, akhi. That's not possible for us. But, with our guns and my ricin, we can still carry out a massive attack that will strike fear into the hearts of kuffar around the world, Allah (SWT) willing. Take a look at the synagogue schedule, akhi: httpJ/www kehHatnitzan org aufworship html There are lots of big events coming up that we could target. Wilayahks and I have picked out our location. Turns out it's actually going to be on September 13. Akhi, do you think you couId agree to carry out the attack on September 13? lt would be perfect. We carry out our attack in Australia, then wilayahks carries out his attack in Kansas City. Looking at the schedule, it would appear that there is a targe Erev Rosh Hashanah service on September 13. We should target that, akhi. This is the absolute perfect time to target. We can't keep waiting, brother. We need to carry out Allah'swill. September 13 at 6 PM at Kehilat Nitzan, akhi. Can you commit to this? I already have a local synagogue to target in Perth too. We attack Australia, then wilayahks attacks Kansas City. We will be legendary martyrs.
