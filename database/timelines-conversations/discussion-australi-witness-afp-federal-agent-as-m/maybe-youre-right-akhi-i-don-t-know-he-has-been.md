# Maybe you’re right akhi, I don't know. He has been such a good brother to me in the past but I am sick of waiting for him also. He's just wanting to do something separate from guns, something that will cause much more destruction, but I don't know, inshallah we can work this out together, he is a good Muslim. i agree akhi, as u know, i have always wanted to stick to the gun idea, i mean, i have the gun and i
want to use it, i want to show the kuffar that they are not untouchable, and that Islam will soon rule the
world. Brothers over in IS would love this wouldn't they?? I'Il google yom kippur, plenty of jews akhi?? What type of celebration is it? Security guiards etc?? lm starting to think that maybe we should act and that maybe this festival would be an idea. I’ll have a
good look akhi, I promise. Maybe I can even influence my brother. .. Do you and wilayahks have a location picked out? Cant you include me a bit more in whats going on there? If our attack would be related to what he is doing then I should know more akhi?? Kuffar cannot capture you brother, you have been too smart with ur internet security. Tor and what not. How couId they even get through that?? Do not be paranoid brother, I had a right to be paranoid when you leaked my twitter on 8chan but I am still here, do not worry. Allah swt is protecting us.
Jzk for your worry akhi, I know you have been there with me for months, let me try and sort out with my Melbourne brolher and i’ll keep u updated. If he's going to take forever, then im more inclined to follow you. At the end of the day, kuffar will pay, our plans will spark fear into ail of their hearts. No one can be safe here. I feel that allah swt has guided me properly. Ma salamah akhi, may allah swt bless you and reward you for your intentions. Alhamdulillah .
