# My Surespot is not working at the moment, so l'm going to have to send you this message here. Brother, do you have any idea how much hard work l've done preparing this attack? Do you have any idea how long l've waited for you, how patient l've been, and how long l've been ready? I have been ready for months, and l've done everything I can to help you get ready too. No other mujahid would have been as patient as I have been. Every time I speak to a mujahid about you, they tell me that I should just stop trying, and they tell me that you're never going to attack with me. But I refuse to give up, because I trust you, brother. You promised me months ago that you would participate in this
attack with me, and a true Muslim doesn't tell false promises. You say that you're waiting for the right time, but, brother, this IS the right time. You're not going to get a better time than this. Allah (SWT) given you the perfect opportunity, yet you refuse to take it. Brother, how many more times are you
going to delay this? At this point, l'm starting to feel betrayed by you. I feel like you're never going to attack with me, even though you promised me you would. And now I hear that you're planning to donate money to brothers in the Islamic State? Akhi, are you TRYING to get caught? Sending money
from Australia to brothers in the dawlah GUARANTEES that the kuffar will capture you. If you want to
inspire brothers in the lslamic State, then you need to carry out this attack with me. THAT is how you help the lslamic State, akhi. But, instead, you just keep making excuses for why you refuse to carry out Allah's will. l'm getting tired of your excuses, brother. l'm starting to agree with what the other mujahideen have told me: I don't think you're ever going to carry out this attack with me. l'm just so disappointed, brother. I really thought you were a true shaheed.
