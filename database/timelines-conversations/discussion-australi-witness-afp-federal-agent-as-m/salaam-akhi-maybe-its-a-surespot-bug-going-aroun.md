# salaam akhi, maybe it’s a surespot bug going around lol. akhi, trust me i know how much you're committed to this and i know you have put a lot into speaking to me about it, i am still going to attack, however my melbourne brother has been in my ear about certain things, and he has suggested making a bigger mark, other than guns ... maybe even
something that will cause more destruction, i dont know. i know you have been ready for months akhi, the thing is, why arent you going to do this by yourself if committing jihad asap is key for you?? i never said i wasnt going to do it. all i said akhi, was that i have progressed a little in my planning and
coordination with my melbourne brother, keeping it local and maximising the attack here in melbourne. Other mujahids will say what they want to benifet themselves, we are all united here but please akhi, just know that im not dismissing everything you have done, i am just taking time to make sure i am doing jihad my way, i hate the kuffar and they need to pay. especially for brainwashing my parents, to which they have shown no remorse for.
i appreciate that you trust me akhi, i trust you too, i just think we are on slightly different pages at the
moment. i need to commit jihad in my own time brother, what can i do to prove my faith and trust to you? to restore your trust?? tell me akhi?? can i send you some money instead? instead of over to IS? im not delaying and telling you false promises, as i said akhi, in my own time, allah swt has a will for
me and me only. i will die a shaheed!!!
