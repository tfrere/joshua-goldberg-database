# Every time a mujahid tries to larget a large evem, he gets caught beforehand. Remember those mujahid who planned to target Anzac Day, but gor caught before they could? The most successful
attacks always happen on random days 9/11, 7/7, and Charlie Hebdo didn’t target any specific events. They were so successful because they happened randomlly and the kuffar were totally
unprepared for them.
