# Brother, I understand what you want to do. You want us to pull of a 9/11 calibre, attack and kill thousands of kuffar. But that’s just not possible right now. Please consider it, brother. We cannot wait any longer.  If we both shoot up synagogues and l send ricin to politicians, it will still be the biggest attack Australia has ever seen. Please consider it, brother. We cannot wait any longer. If we keep delaying this, the kuffar wiII find us and stop us before we can attack.
