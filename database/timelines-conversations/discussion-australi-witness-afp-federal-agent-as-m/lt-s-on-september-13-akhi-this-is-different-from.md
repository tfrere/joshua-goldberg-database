# lt's on September 13, akhi. This is different from what I was telling you about before. This is Erev Rosh Hashanah, which cornes before Yom Kippur. lt will be very crowded, and there will be tons of Jewish kuffar to kill. The services at the Melbourne synagogue I showed you start on September 13 at 6 PM. Remember that, akhi. The address is 36-40 Hawthorn Road, Caulfield North. Here it is on a
map: http://www.street-directory.com au/sd_new/mapsearch.cgi?star=5&5&&x=145.025205&y=-

I am so glad you've finally agreed to carry this out with me, brother. We are going to become legendary shaheeds, Allah (SWT) willing. We will be rewarded with seats right next to the Prophet
(PBUH) in Jannah. Remember, brother: from now on, you have to get on Surespot every day. We don't have much time left. We have to carry this out on September 13.
