# Akhi, your Melbourne brother is going to get you caught. He has no idea what he's talking about. The
longer you delay this attack and the more people you get involved, the more likely you are to get caught. Lone wolf attacks with guns are the most effective kind of attack for striking terror into the hearts of the kuffar. You need to forget about this idea of pulling off some "bigger" attack. Brother, we cannot pull off a 9/11-caliber attack in Australia. We do not have the time or resources for that. What we CAN do is carry out the biggest attack in Australian history if we both attack on the same day. The
attack is already going to be huge if you just agree to carry it out. Trying to make it even "bigger" will only get us caught. Akhi, I really think you need to forget about bringing your Melbourne brother along for this. He can become a shaheed some other way, akhi. But, right now, he's only going to delay this
attack even further. On September 13 is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. lf you're not willing to attack by then, then I don't think you're ever going to attack. Yom Kippur is the absolute best possible time to attack the kuffar. The synagogue will be more crowded than ever. Remember, brother: the Jews are the ones who brainwashed your parents. The Jews are the ones who control the kuffar government and the
kuffar media. The Jews are the ones who slaughter innocent Muslims around the world. The Jews killed the Rasul (SAW). So, if we truly love the Prophet (PBUH), then we are obligated to carry out jihad against Jews.
You say you want to commit the attack on "your own time", but when is "your own time", brother? When? When are you ever going to be ready? lt doesn't seem like you ever are. Allah's will for you is to carry out this attack, and you are making excuses for why you refuse to carry out Allah's will. Allah's will does not accept excuses, brother. On September 11, wilayahks will carry out his attack in Kansas City. Once wilayahks carries out his attack, the kuffar are going to try harder than ever to track me down - and they might actually manage
to capture me. And, if the kuffar capture me, they will also capture my friends. If we don't enter Jannah within the next few days, we will get caught, akhi. Do you want us to get captured by the kuffar and tortured for information, brother? Or do you want to enter Jannah? The choice is yours.
Please, akhi - please carry out this attack with me. You have had months and months to get ready. I have been as patient as I can possibly be. No more excuses, brother. lt's time for us to become shaheeds and carry out Allah's will together. If you do this with me, your name will become legendary,
and the kuffar will feel terror in their hearts just from the mere mention of your name. You will become a heroic martyr for mujahideen around the world. But, if you keep delaying this, you wi ll be just another mujahid who got caught before he could attack. Make your decision soon, brother. There isn't much time left.
