# Right now, I'm trying to get a mujahid in Melbourne to carry out jihad, but he keeps delaying it. He has a gun already, but he insists on making a video message to the kuffar with a black shahada flag. He also insists on getting his friend to carry out jihad with him. I am afraid he'll get caught before he can do it.
