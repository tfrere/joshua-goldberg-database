# This guy said he wanted to carry out this attack so I said, uh, make a bomb and
he asked what kind of bomb and I suggested a pipe bomb, a pressure cooker
bomb, I think the pressure cooker bomb might have been his idea, but I, sent him
instructions on how to make one and he sent me pictures of the bomb, which I
screen capped and those are on my computer. I screencapped the stuff he sent
me and getting him admitting to this.
