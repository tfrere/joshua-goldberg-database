# First I thought the guys were just trolls, I guess I thought if the FBI or whatever
came I would pretend I had a guy and that was how I would die cause I've
always, like I said, I’ve always wanted to kill myself, but I've never had the guts
to do it and I still don’t. So when you came, I just got on the floor like he said
and I wouldn’t want to hurt my family even though, obviously I already have, a
great deal.
