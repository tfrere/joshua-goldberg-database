# No, just thinking about what I'm gonna do. My family doesn’t have a lot of
money to be able to afford a good lawyer. It just doesn’t feel real. I guess I never
really see things as real, this whole world always felt like, like it’s a dream or
something. It’s hard to describe, I’m the only real person, everyone else is just
like a figment of my imagination. It’s something I think about all the time.
