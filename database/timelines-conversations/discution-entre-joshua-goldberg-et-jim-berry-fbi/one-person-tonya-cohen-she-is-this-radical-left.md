# One person Tonya Cohen, she is this radical, left-wing, social
justice activist from Australia who moved to the U.S. Ryoko Tamanda is a
Japanese woman involved in Libertarian politics who lives in Tokyo, Michael
Slay is a neo-Nazi who I, that was one of my most convincing ones because I
actually managed to get accepted onto a real bunch of, the most read neo-Nazi
site, the Daily Stormer, as Michael Slay and he really believed I was real.
But eventually, he kicked me off because, to create a story I posed as
another person from Australia, Josh Bornstein, and posted something on the
Times of Israel calling for Palestinians to be killed and then posted about that on
the Daily Stormer as Michael Slay and he didn’t want to get in trouble or get
sued or anything so he kicked me out, he kicked Michael Slay off. I mean, and
that’s not even half the personalities I created online.
