# I was going to try to stop it from actually being carried out by sending the
information to the police. Like at the last minute and I thought the details that I'd posted about it online
were really accessible to the police so I figured they were already gonna stop it.
Cause if I actually wanted this stuff to happen, keep in mind, if I actually wanted
this stuff to happen, I would not have made so many posts explicitly telling what
exactly was going to happen. I would have kept it a secret. But the thing is, I
wanted these people to get caught, which is why I made so many posts giving
away their username and what their plans were, if I wanted this stuff to happen, I
would not have posted any of that.
