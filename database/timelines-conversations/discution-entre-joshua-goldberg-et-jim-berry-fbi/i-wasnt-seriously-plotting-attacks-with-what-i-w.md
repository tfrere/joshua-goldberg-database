# I wasn’t seriously plotting attacks with, what I was telling you was, first off, I
didn’t even think these people were even real, I thought they were people like
me, you know, and, or, or a journalist that are trying to uncover...
you know, going undercover or stuff like that or, uh, FBI agents and...I told them
I was going to do stuff to try to get them to believe that I was real. I talked to them that I was going to attack Perth, Australia, which obviously I can’t since I live here.
