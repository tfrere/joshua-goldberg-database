# I didn’t actually encourage them to do anything really, I just, on
the AustraliWitness account I just posted about this, this was gonna be in Garland
and then these people who followed that account re-tweeted that so they gave my
fake account credit for it, credit for inspiring it, but I didn’t actually talk to those
people and I’m not lying here, I did not actually talk to those people. They
followed me and they saw that I posted about it and re-tweeted me and I think
they re-tweeted a few other people too.
