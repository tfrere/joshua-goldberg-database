Procès: Did he indicate whether he would be able to go?
A. Yes. So he told me he doesn't fly. Again, he
reaffirmed that he doesn't fly and he had a lot of ground to
cover. And this was May 2, the day before the event. And
so he said he probably wouldn't be able to make it just
because of driving distance.
