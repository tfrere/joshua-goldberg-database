Procès: What was his response?
A. So he clarified -- because I was kind of questioning
saying like I don't think I understand what you mean.
And so he came back and said that I should do a unique
one-man protest, which still seemed odd to me because who
does it's not conventional when you think of rallies and
protests for just one man to do a unique protest.
