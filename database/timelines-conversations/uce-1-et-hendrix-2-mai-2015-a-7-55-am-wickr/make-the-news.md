OBSERVATION CAMILLE: Gold
Observation heure: heure inventée
Procès: So I said basically make the news, meaning whatever this intended unique one-man protest is, is probably going
to make the news.
And I was trying to get him an opportunity to clarify
by when he meant, because if he meant some peaceful
conventional protest, then this is his opportunity to
clarify to me what he intended.
