# Thank you, brother. For the past several months, I have been
coordinating an act of jihad with a mujahid who lives in Melbourne.
He sold bis car to buy a gun, but be basn't carried out the attack yet because he wants to make a video message to the kuffar with a black shahada flag, and he also wants his friend to participate in the attack with him. However, I haven't heard anything from him since July 24th. I have tried messaging him on Surespot, DMing him on Twitter, and emailing him, but he won't respond. I am very worried that he may have been captured by the kuffar. What should l do, akhi?
