Can you help me find a publisher if I provide you with links to all of the Australian jihadists I know of who have active Twitter accounts?,MoonMetropolis,"May 26, 2015"
A single link?,Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
"Are they “real” jihadists, or is that not my concern?",Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
And yes.,Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
I can,Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
What would be their interest?,Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
Like as a yellow pages? A-Z of camel jockeys,Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
"I have links to numerous accounts of real ISIS  jihadists who live in Australia or used to live in Australia before going to Syria
It’s obvious why a journalist would be interested in following them",MoonMetropolis,"May 26, 2015"
"You waste a lot of time on the Internet, just like me.",Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
"I am on the Internet literally almost every single waking moment. I’m not exaggerating. I get up, get on the Internet for hours, then sleep.
Only very occasionally do I leave the Internet to go see a movie or (…)",MoonMetropolis,"May 26, 2015"
Nothing.,Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
You’ve been trolling for a long time eh.,Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
"Trollin ain’t easy, but somebody’s gotta do it.",MoonMetropolis,"May 26, 2015"
Yeah…,Mac Mahon,"May 26, 2015"
"Why are you a vegetarian?
Do you love cute animals?",Mac Mahon,"May 28, 2015"
Or for health reasons?,Mac Mahon,"May 28, 2015"
For the animals.,MoonMetropolis,"May 28, 2015"
"I can understand environmental arguments.
Really? You have an affection for the animals?",Mac Mahon,"May 28, 2015"
Yes.,MoonMetropolis,"May 28, 2015"
How curious.,Mac Mahon,"May 28, 2015"
"Have you ever had contact with any journalist from Fairfax Media? http://theage.com.au/?
I’m not asking because I’ve been employed by them. In fact, I doubt I’ll ever will get any jobs from them after my efforts.",Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
"Well, yeah. Fairfax printed some of the bullshit I fed them. Remember?",MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"I do recall them writing about a witness - yeah. But did they ever actually have direct contact with you?
Or the bullshit you I should say..?",Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
I talked to a few journalists using this account. I’m not sure which ones were Fairfax.,MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"This account? Or AustraliWitness…
I’m trying to work out why this guy is lying to me…
Claiming credit for shit…",Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
"This account. The jihadist account talked to journalists too, though.",MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"Hey, can you get any Australian media outlets to report on this? washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/…",MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"Make sure they include the part where the local Islamic leader says this :
“Everybody has a right to be a bigot. Everybody has a right to be a racist. Everybody has a right to be an idiot.”
Australians would be absolutely stunned by a minority person saying that.",MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"Here’s another link : http://12news.com/story/news/cc%E2%80%A6And
And the video where he says that : http://nbcnews.com/watch/nbc-news%E2%80%A6",MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"I’m not sure I can get anyone to pick up on it…
The Australian might.",,"May 29, 2015"
"Yes, they probably would. See if you can get them to report on it, with the local Islamic leader’s comments and all.",MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"It’s tomorrow?
Or today?",Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
Today.,,"May 29, 2015"
It will only be postfacto reporting then,,"May 29, 2015"
"Honestly, I just want to get that Islamic leader’s “everybody has a right to be a bigot” comments printed in an Australian paper.",,"May 29, 2015"
Lol,Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
"So, do you think you’d be able to get them to report on it?",MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"I very much doubt it. A) It’s the weekend, which is dominated by sport.
B) Everything will be already set for publication.",Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
What if some durkas attack it?,MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"Then, like the parasitical rodents that the press are, they will feed of the carnage
Off*",Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
Are there any Australian sites that might write and publish a story about it today? Like news.com.au?,MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
"Just out of curiosity, are you confident I can’t or don’t already know your identity? Not that it should concern you at all, but does it?
And if so why!
?
Excuse the exclamation mark.",Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
"M8, you don’t know my identity. You might think you do, but you don’t.",MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
I’m not saying I do. I’m asking if it concerns you and if so why?,Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
I’m not losing any sleep over it.,MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
I’m sure you’re not - and admitted you have been careful.,Mac Mahon,"May 29, 2015"
"I mean, even if you do know who I am, what are you gonna do to me? Turn me in to the Feds for pretending to be a terrorist?",MoonMetropolis,"May 29, 2015"
Did you ever end up speaking to any of the jihadis?,Mac Mahon,"June 5, 2015"
"Not on IRC, I speak to them on Twitter and email.
Also, Facebook is really pissing me off. They “approve” my ads, but then nobody receives them. WTF?",MoonMetropolis,"June 5, 2015"
"Lol, what kind of shit are you saying to the jihadis?
Are you using the same proxy? They can just put flags on whole I.p ranges",Mac Mahon,"June 5, 2015"
"I’m just feeding them bullshit.
And I’m not using proxies at the moment, because I’m not on my laptop.",MoonMetropolis,"June 5, 2015"
Well then they would have flagged your I.P address,Mac Mahon,"June 5, 2015"
"can I ask, just out of curiosity, what motivates this activity?
I ask because, I myself have a long long history of doing shit - and I’m fairly clear about why I do it… you, i’m confused.",Mac Mahon,"June 8, 2015"
To cause a bunch of chaos and piss people off.,MoonMetropolis,"June 8, 2015"
"That is a good enough reason. Its also transnational, I know the feeling of watching shit go down, its awesome.
transactional*
but the politics behind it…
White power is kind of gay.",Mac Mahon,"June 8, 2015"
"White supremacists are useful idiots for me. Again, I also pretend to be a SJW on some accounts.",MoonMetropolis,"June 8, 2015"
"Who are you wanting to email?
Gov? private person ?",Mac Mahon,"June 21, 2015"
"A journalist.
It’s threatening a terror attack.",MoonMetropolis,"June 21, 2015"
"The guy at BBC stopped emailing me. Also, which list?
Oh, and I’m not meaning to complain or nag you or anything, but are you still going to edit that Tanya Cohen article I sent you?",MoonMetropolis,"June 29, 2015"
Quite honestly - I’ve not had a chance to look at it yet. I’m writing a 8000 word paper on the Australian Data Retention scheme.,Mac Mahon,"June 29, 2015"
I deleted the DM - but I recall you mentioned something about having a twitter list of jihadis?,Mac Mahon,"June 29, 2015"
"Here are some jihadist accounts from Australia:
@AussieRevert
@mjm1486
@Jamil-Elbiza
@DrKAus
@mahkiwa / @omar-australi
@ShuuHabib",MoonMetropolis,"June 29, 2015"
Awesome. Thanks dude.,Mac Mahon,"June 29, 2015"
"@Tawheed_nation
@SteveHoyt2
@UssayAllslam
@ami_salfullah
@abuzaidaswi
@mohamadmo7
No problem.",MoonMetropolis,"June 29, 2015"
"You got access to any of these?
Any of those looked down i mean/…",Mac Mahon,"June 29, 2015"
What do you mean?,MoonMetropolis,"June 29, 2015"
Some of them are private accounts.,Mac Mahon,"June 29, 2015"
Oh…yeah. I can get access to them if you need me to. I got fake jihadist accounts.,MoonMetropolis,"June 29, 2015"
"Need to find photos of the 2 Aussie Jihadis reported dead - see if one of ",Mac Mahon,"June 29, 2015"
People are stupid. it’s amusing to get reactions out of people who are too stupid to know what they’re being played for fools.,MoonMetropolis,"June 29, 2015"
"Sure, I agree - but you are also motivated by a particular set of ideas - you can’t really deny that.",Mac Mahon,"June 29, 2015"
"Not really. I use some fake accounts to push Neo-Nazism, and others to push SJW-ism. Whatever will cause chaos.",MoonMetropolis,"June 29, 2015"
"See, now I know for sure you’re lying. I’ve never posted my pic online. If you wanted me to believe you, you shouldn’t have said that.",MoonMetropolis,"July 1, 2015"
"Okcupid.
Your intro also gave you away.",Mac Mahon,"July 1, 2015"
"Also, I did school at home and I never had any friends. There are no “school friends” to “confirm” anything.",MoonMetropolis,"July 1, 2015"
It did make me chuckle,Mac Mahon,"July 1, 2015"
"Middle school
Im not making any of this up. Why would I?",Mac Mahon,"July 1, 2015"
Or maybe you do think I’m making it up?,Mac Mahon,"July 1, 2015"
"Shall I call you on your home number?
lol
3119 Pine Rd Orange Park, 904-278-6350
Happy now?",Mac Mahon,"July 1, 2015"
"Maybe I should call Rebecca and Frank and have them confirm it for me?
Can with quit with all the sock puppet stuff?",Mac Mahon,"July 2, 2015"
"Oh…I’m sorry, you were saying something about Amina?",Mac Mahon,"July 2, 2015"
Like I said - I’ve been sitting on this information for a while:,"Image, Mac Mahon","July 2, 2015"
Did you finish editing that Tanya Cohen article?,MoonMetropolis,"July 5, 2015"
"No, I think it’s shit.
It’s so poorly written it’s not worth editing.",Mac Mahon,"July 5, 2015"
"It’s childishly bad.
Perhaps downs childish.",Mac Mahon,"July 5, 2015"
"That’s the whole fucking point. I’m trying to get stupid, poorly-written shit on HuffPo.
You really don’t get it, do you? Tanya Cohen is a CHARACTER. She’s not a good writer. She’s a typical idiot Greens supporter.",MoonMetropolis,"July 5, 2015"
"Anyway, I knew I couldn’t rely on you, so I’m already having someone else edit it.",MoonMetropolis,"July 5, 2015"
Trust me - it’s you who does not get it.,Mac Mahon,"July 5, 2015"
"No, genius, it’s called trolling. I’m trying to make HuffPo look like a bunch of idiots by getting them to publish poorly-written garbage.",MoonMetropolis,"July 5, 2015"
"BTW, I found some more Australian jihadists:
@AbdelBakiAU
@moevAK47
@dasulafillon
@AbuOsamaAIAustr
@MahmoudSOA
@AbuZee83
@abukhalidaloozi",MoonMetropolis,"July 13, 2015"
Cool…,Mac Mahon,"July 13, 2015"
What’s your latest aventure?,Mac Mahon,"July 15, 2015"
It has to go on IRC because it’s Guantanamo Bay-caliber stuff.,MoonMetropolis,"July 15, 2015"
"I’m only on vacation because I have to be.
And there was, but it got banned.",MoonMetropolis,"August 5, 2015"
I am literally not capable of having fun. Seriously.,MoonMetropolis,"August 6, 2015"
Sounds like you might have convinced yourself that’s the case.,Mac Mahon,"August 6, 2015"
"To be honest, I don’t really take pleasure in anything.",MoonMetropolis,"August 7, 2015"
"That’s clearly not true.
I know you love fooling people. You clearly enjoy it.",Mac Mahon,"August 8, 2015"
It’s just something I do to kill time.,MoonMetropolis,"August 8, 2015"
"I don’t believe that…
Come on dude, admit you love it…
Also how did stay get banned from twitter?",Mac Mahon,"August 8, 2015"
"No, I really don’t feel pleasure, I do things mostly just because I can.",MoonMetropolis,"August 8, 2015"
"My god like powers have have been unable to turn shit up.
Meaning I think youre ok.
I’ll be swimming in your pool next summer bitch",Mac Mahon,"August 25, 2015"
"Again, my parents don’t want AIDS in their pool. But, if you’re coming to Florida, you should go to…
…well, actually, you shouldn’t go anywhere, because Florida fucking sucks.
Seriously",MoonMetropolis,"August 25, 2015"
"I’ll come visit you when they lock you up in the Fed Prison
Besides, your parents can’t catch something they already have…
When they told you they gave you aids at birth….. were you like… “oh the shame”…..",Mac Mahon,"August 25, 2015"
