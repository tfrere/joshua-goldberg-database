# Perfect. Just keep a safe
distance from the bomb. Vou
don't wanna get hit with any
shrapnel. And, when you're
carrying the bomb in your
backpack, just try to make
yourself look like everyone else
to avoid suspicion. Look down
at your phone and pretend to
text if the kuffar start looking at
you suspiciously.
