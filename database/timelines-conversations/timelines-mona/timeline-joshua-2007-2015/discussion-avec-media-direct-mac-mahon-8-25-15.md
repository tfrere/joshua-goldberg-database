Again, my parents don’t want AIDS in their pool. But, if you’re coming to Florida, you should go to…

I’ll come visit you when they lock you up in the Fed Prison 

Besides, your parents can’t catch something they already have…

When they told you they gave you aids at birth….. were you like… “oh the shame”…..
