*If a robot is sentient, do they have just as much right to life as humans? What if the robot was an exact replica of a human - right down to the emotions, the vulnerability, the unpredictability, ect. If a robot is physically, psychologically, and emotionally equivalent to a human, would you consider it a human? Perhaps a "manufactured" human?*
