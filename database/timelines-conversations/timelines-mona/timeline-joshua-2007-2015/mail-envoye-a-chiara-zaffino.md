Object : Junaid Thorne Information 

*Dear Mr.Minear,*

*Recently, I set up a fake account under the name Junaid Thorne, impersonating the Perth-based Islamic radical preacher (https://twitter.com/JunaidThorne). Immediately, Australian jihadists began to follow me and engage in conversations with me.*

*The real Junaid Thorne eventually caught on and set up a real account for himself (https://twitter.com/MJunaidThorne1). However, by impersonating Junaid, I was able to extract some very interesting information from his followers when they thought I was him. In particular, I learned that jihadists in Australia are planning to attack cartoonists Bill Leak and Larry Pickering, both of whom drew cartoons poking fun at Muhammed.*

*Here is some information that I gathered about Junaid Thorne’s followers.*

*Most of these screenshots were taken a while ago, and most of the accounts have since been suspended (ISIS accounts are CONSTANTLY suspended and then re-created).*

*As you read these screenshots, please keep in mind that I had to keep in character and act like I approved of what they were saying.*

*Some of the info that I wasn’t able to screenshot includes:*

*Some of them shared this link (which, ironically, is a neo-Nazi blog) and talked about car-bombing the place : [https://cj303addict.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/almost-all-zionist-organizations-in-australia-are-located-on-one-street/](https://cj303addict.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/almost-all-zionist-organizations-in-australia-are-located-on-one-street/) (a user called @BasimaFaysal managed to screenshot one person sharing this link, but he didn’t screenshot the car-bombing discussion)*

*Some of them talked about the Reclaim Australia rallies and suggested attacking it, but others said that it would be a waste of time because the people at the rally are all “stupid junkies” and “drunk bogans”.*

*A ton of them praised the Lindt Cafe attack and promised that there would be more just like it.*

*Keep in mind, the screenshots here are only a TINY fraction of the interactions that I’ve had with ISIS supporters on Twitter. There was much, MUCH more. But, again, you pretty much have to screenshot all of this stuff immediately, because ISIS accounts are taken down at a rapid pace.*

*Overall, it’s pretty stunning how many of them claimed to be connected with the Human Rights Law Center (@rightsagenda) and/or Amnesty International.*

*I can provide you with more information if you’d like me to. I have also found chatter about killing Leak & Pickering on other Islamic jihadist websites (for example : https://archive.is/kXwNU)*
