1960's ASTRO BOY EPISODES ARE COMING SOON.

You can subscribe to my channel and I will try to rip the episodes off my DVD box-set.

I have lots of favorites, but YouTube is screwed up.

If you have a Tezuka work that you would like me to upload, then please let me know.

This page is dedicated to the greatest manga artist of all-time.

I also invite you to join my group.

If you are a fan of Tezuka-sensei, then please join! ^_^

Tezuka newbies are also welcome.

Anyone is welcome. ^_^

Don't ask me for my real age... I'm not gonna answer, you stupid creep.  Although, people will somehow find my age anyway... O_O

The videos I post will be strictly Tezuka-related, even though I can post many other stuff.

Yes, I am a Japan whore and obsessed with Japan.  Why do you ask? ^_~

A.K.A. Metropolisforever, among others... ^*~ ^*^
