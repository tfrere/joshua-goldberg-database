# Tokyogirl79 : So far three people have come to your page and asked you to provide better/more sourcing on your articles and so far you've basically clapped your hands over your ears and insisted that nothing was wrong with your articles. What bothers me about this the most is that initially you did make some decently sourced articles. They didn't have proper inline citations, but they did have sources. I'm not sure why at some point you decided to do ''less'' work instead of doing the work properly.
