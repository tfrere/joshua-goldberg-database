**MEDIA DIRECT**

Have you ever had contact with any journalist from Fairfax Media? Theage.com.au?

I’m not asking because I’ve been employed by them. In fact, I doubt I’ll ever will get any jobs from them after my efforts.

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Well, yeah. Fairfax printed some of the bullshit I fed them. Remember?

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

I do recall them writing about a witness - yeah. But did they ever actually have direct contact with you?

Or the bullshit you I should say..?

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I talked to a few journalists using this account. I’m not sure which ones were Fairfax.

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

This account? Or AustraliWitness…

I’m trying to work out why this guy is lying to me…

Claiming credit for shit…

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

This account. The jihadist account talked to journalists too, though.

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Hey, can you get any Australian media outlets to report on this? washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/…

*May 29*

Make sure they include the part where the local Islamic leader says this :

“Everybody has a right to be a bigot. Everybody has a right to be a racist. Everybody has a right to be an idiot.”

Australians would be absolutely stunned by a minority person saying that.

Here’s another link : [12news.com/story/news/cc…](http://12news.com/story/news/cc…And)

And the video where he says that : nbcnews.com/watch/nbc-news…

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

I’m not sure I can get anyone to pick up on it…

The Australian might.

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Yes, they probably would. See if you can get them to report on it, with the local Islamic leader’s comments and all.

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

It’s tomorrow?

Or today?

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Today.

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

It will only be postfacto reporting then

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Honestly, I just want to get that Islamic leader’s “everybody has a right to be a bigot” comments printed in an Australian paper.

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

Lol

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

So, do you think you’d be able to get them to report on it?

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

I very much doubt it. A) It’s the weekend, which is dominated by sport.

B) Everything will be already set for publication.

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

What if some durkas attack it?

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

Then, like the parasitical rodents that the press are, they will feed of the carnage

Off*

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Are there any Australian sites that might write and publish a story about it today? Like news.com.au?

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

Just out of curiosity, are you confident I can’t or don’t already know your identity? Not that it should concern you at all, but does it?

And if so why!

?

Excuse the exclamation mark.

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

M8, you don’t know my identity. You might think you do, but you don’t.

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

I’m not saying I do. I’m asking if it concerns you and if so why?

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I’m not losing any sleep over it.

*May 29*

**MEDIA DIRECT**

I’m sure you’re not - and admitted you have been careful.

*May 29*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I mean, even if you do know who I am, what are you gonna do to me? Turn me in to the Feds for pretending to be a terrorist?

*May 29*
