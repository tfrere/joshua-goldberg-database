*Dear Mr. Taylor,*

*I frequently persude Islamic extremist communities (along with neo-Nazi communities) and I have noticed some chatter on both of them about having Bill Leak and Larry pickering killed.*

*Here, we have someone on 4chan’s /pol/ (a popular neo-Nazi* *hangout) encouraging people to contact radical Islamic groups in Australia in order to have them kill the cartoonists, which would then “increase nationalism” : http//archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/43817729/*

*The flags next to each post show which country the poster is from. This thread was apaprently posted by someone from Greenland.*

*That thread was posted numerous times, and it was also posted on 8chan several times as well. I’ve seen a new version of the thread posted almost every day. For example, it was also posted as a response to this thread : [https://archive.today/UPVSb](https://archive.today/UPVSb) (you have to scroll  down quite a lot to find it)*

*There was a thread on Islamic Awakening about Bill Leak, but that site is down at the moment.*

*As for the article that you wrote, it should be updated.*

*It wasn’t IslamicStateAU who said that they were gonna have Leak and Pickering killed. It was someone called ShamiWitness. There “ShamiWitness”, as a quick search reveals.*

*The Hasan Ali IS guy was talking to a Reclaim Australia supporter named Nathan Sykes (since suspended as well) when he said that he would conquer Australia.*

*You should also DEFINITELY mention the connections with Amnesty International Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre. That’s very important information.*
