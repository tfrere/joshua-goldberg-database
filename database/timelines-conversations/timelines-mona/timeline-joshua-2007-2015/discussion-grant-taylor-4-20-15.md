Yeah sorry, been a bit crook last couple of days. I have forwarded it to AFP.

Did you detect a note of sarcasm in the original neoNazi post?

It is hard to tell if they are being serious or joking. No doubt the ithough that dea spread pretty quickly to others who may not have seen

the joke. not really sure what to male of it to be honest. You?

To be honest, if it were a joke, I don’t think they would have posted it so many times & included links to real Islamic extremist groups.

The same post was made over and over and over again, all of them by someone from Greenland.

If it were a joke, I don’t see why they would be so eager to repost it… unless they actually did want people to carry out the instructions.

Do you plan to update the article, though?

I mean, to fix the error and to add the information about the jihadists working with “human rights” groups.

I did ask for it to be changed but it had already been replaced on the website by the terror raids in Melbourne. Again junaid links.

You are probably right re the Neo nazi post. The intent is clearly to plant a seed in someone’s head.

I’m still having discussions with jihadists on the account. Can I send you some more info so you can write a new article…

…and include the info about “human rights” groups in it?

There’s an Aussie jihadist I’m talking to right now who is providing me with all sorts of “interesting” info.
