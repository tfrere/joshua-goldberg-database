He’d probably just respond with something about Twitter being run by kuffar.

BTW, if ISIS attacks London, it will probably be today.

*May 15*

Friday is the day when the largest amount of Muslims are praying in mosques. Today would be the day that ISIS would shoot up a mail.

They’ve been threatening to do it all week with their #LondonAttack Tweets.

*May 15*

It could just be keyboard warrior bullshit, but those threats were much more specific than the usual “hurka we will kill the infidels”

Two of them posted pictures of their guns and bombs for an imminent London attack, and some others talked about attacking a shopping mall.

Why would they do Friday? That’s the least likely day surely

Given prayers etc

*May 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Because that’s the day when the most amount of Muslims are praying, so, in a shooting, they’d kill the most non-Muslims & the least Muslims.

Oh I see. Yeah possibly a good point

But already past prayer time no?
