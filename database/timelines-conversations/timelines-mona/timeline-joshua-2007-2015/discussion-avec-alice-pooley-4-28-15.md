Hi yes I did - Thankyou. It looks like you did great work, but I’ve just seen online the west has published a story about your account?

They made mistakes in their article. & they forgot to include the information about jihadist links to Amnesty & the Human Rights Law Centre.

Also, I have uncovered more info since then.

I see - Could you send me what you’ve uncovered that the west didn’t include?

Actually maybe we should talk over the phone?
