Hey… are you going to write an article about the info that I sent you regarding Junaid’s followers?

*Apr 20*

**CYNDI LAVRENCIC**

Hello - sorry not at this stage. We wanted it on Saturday which is when the info first came out, but with the time difference etc 1/2

It didn’t make it. I’ll contact you again if we do! Thanks so much for your help though 2/2

No problem. Let me know if you need more info. I’m currently talking with another Aussie jihadist who is providing quite a lot of info.

**CYNDI LAVRENCIC**

Yeah thanks. Any planned attacks? Will you start forwarding info on to authorities?

*Apr 22*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Aside from the planned attacks on Leak&Pickening, there’s been some chatter about attacking Anzac Day parades, esp. in Sydney & Melbourne.

**CYNDI LAVRENCIC**

Is that recent? A number of people were arrested over the weekend in relation to a planned attack

*Apr 22*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

It’s been going on for a few days now. It’s still ongoing.

Could you send me some of the newer screenshots? I can forward them without your contact. Unless you wanted to report yourself?

Not sure if you wanted to remain completely anon

*Apr 22*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Hold on, let me see if I can find some of the conversations.

*Apr 22*

Here’s a thread on 8chan’s /islam/ board about attacking Anzac Day: archive.is/1ju74. Flags by the posts : the posters’ locations.

Note how the Australian posters have different IDs, meaning they’re different people.

**CYNDI LAVRENCIC**

Right right. Posted today. Thanks for that - let me know if anything else comes up

*Apr 22*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

No problem.

Will you be posting an article this Saturday? Or have you abandoned the article altogether?
