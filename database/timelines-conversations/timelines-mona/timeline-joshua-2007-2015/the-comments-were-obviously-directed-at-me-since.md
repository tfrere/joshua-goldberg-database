# The comments were obviously directed at ME, since they were left on the top of MY talk page and referred to ME as a "cunt". It's not the first time that someone has left that kind of vandalism on my talk page. Look at its history. It's people from 4chan targeting me (â€¦)

*I've made it so you can't edit your talk page, since I'm assuming the IP is you. I hope that you're aware that making personal threats like that makes it pretty much impossible for you to get unblocked from Wikipedia.*

*Also, I've made the block permanent now, since your comments pretty much show that you'd have continued this harassment when the block was up. All you had to do was wait out the block and then start contributing in a more positive manner where you treat other editors with respect and read over guidelines a little better. You showing that you are unwilling to do this and stating that you wanted me (I assume it's me, since the other two editors were male) to undergo physical and sexual violence because I blocked you was probably one of the most unwise things you could have done.*

*There are so many things wrong here that I really don't even know where to begin.*

*1. The comments were obviously directed at ME, since they were left on the top of MY talk page and referred to ME as a "cunt". It's not the first time that someone has left that kind of vandalism on my talk page. Look at its history. It's people from 4chan targeting me.*

*2. None of those IP addresses belong to me. If they did, they would have been autoblocked since I was blocked at the time. Also, believe or not, I really do have better things to do than tell myself that I hope I get raped and killed.*

*3. The fact that you are so paranoid that you actually think that the vandalism on MY talk page is directed at YOU - even though it was AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE - really says it all.*

*4. You assuming that those vandal IP addresses belong to me is assuming bad faith in the extreme.*

*Don't believe me? Feel free to use Checkuser.*

*I almost cannot believe how absurd and paranoid you are being right now.--[[User:Madotsuki the Dreamer|Madotsuki the Dreamer]] ([[User talk:Madotsuki the Dreamer#top|talk]]) 15:54, 9 September 2015 (UTC)*
