*Hi mate, the person behind the account called Australi Witness is being hunted by the federal police over claims he helped incite the Texas shooting. Posted on his old account the location of the event and maps of the venue. Just wondered if he had revealed anything to you about who he is or where he is. We have heard he is from Perth - which is where I’m from - but can’t confirm it.*

*He lives in Perth and used to work for Amnesty International. I’ve been following his activity for a while. He formerly posted as IslamicStateEng and IslamicStateAU. I think his name might be Hasan Ali.*

*A guy called HasanAlilS made similar Tweets and also claimed to know Mariam Veiszadeh : https://twitter.com/TheArbiter1/status/571957841390522368*

*A guy called Hasan Ali also made a post on the Islamic Awakening forums about Bill Leak, but those forums have since been taken down, so I can’t link you to. There’s a chance the board might come back up, though.*

Y*ou know everyone! Will be interesting to see if our corps can pin a charge on him. Would be the first time they have used the incitement provisions of new anti-terror laws introduced last month.*

*He said his parents were from Lebanon and that he’s lived in Australia his whole life. He said that he was raised Muslim, but that his family is unaware of his social media activities.*

*He also said he uses “multiple proxies” online” and presents himself as a moderate in real life.*
