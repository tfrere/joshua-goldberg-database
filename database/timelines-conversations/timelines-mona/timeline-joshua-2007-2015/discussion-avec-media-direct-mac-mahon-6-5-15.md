**MEDIA DIRECT**

Did you ever end up speaking to any of the jihadis?

Not on IRC, I speak to them on Twitter and email.

Also, Facebook is really pissing me off. They “approve” my ads, but then nobody receives them. WTF?

Lol, what kind of shit are you saying to the jihadis?

Are you using the same proxy? They can just put flags on whole I.p ranges

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I’m just feeding them bullshit.

And I’m not using proxies at the moment, because I’m not on my laptop.

**MEDIA DIRECT**

Well then they would have flagged your I.P address
