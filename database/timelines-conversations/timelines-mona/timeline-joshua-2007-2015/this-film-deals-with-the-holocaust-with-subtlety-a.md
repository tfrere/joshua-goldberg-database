# This film deals with the Holocaust with subtlety and realism. There is no Hollywood psuedo-sentimentality like you'd see in a Spielberg film. There is just this man, who, despite his coldness, we feel sympathy for. We watch as he tries to interact with other people, only to end up hurting everyone around him. We see how his classification of all people as "scum" is just as bad as the Nazi ideology.

*Well, IMDb says that the Original Aspect Ratio is 1.33:1. I know they can be very inaccurate, but not usually when it comes to aspect ratio stuff.*

*Anyways, what a film! As a person who has been disappointed by almost every "great" film they've seen, I was very engaged and moved by this. I hear of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver being a masterpiece of character study. Maybe to some people it is, but nothing can compare to Sidney Lumet's masterpiece.*

*I especially loved the poetic, heartbreaking, but possibly hopeful ending.*

*It's too bad Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore. Nowadays, we get manufactured junk like "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas" every year, but we never get filmmaking as honest, open, and daring as this was.*
