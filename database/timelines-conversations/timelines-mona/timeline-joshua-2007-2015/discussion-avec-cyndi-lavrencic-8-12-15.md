Are Australian police aware of the detailed new threats posted by Australi Witness? He evn posted a video of this friend shooting a rifle.

Is that the one you were thinking of?

Check out the video link. It actually does show someone firing a rifle.

Yes it is, yeah posted July

Australi Witness made a post in the thread a few days ago, saying he hasn’t heard from the gun-owning jihadist since July 24.

Do you know if police captured him? I mean, if they did, it would be on the news, woudn’t it?

You would think so but I don’t remeber anything. News like that would make it to Perth. Very strange

Well, Australi Witness claims to live in Perth, but the guy he says is going to shoot up a synagogue is supposedly from Melbourne.

I can’t imagine that it WOULDN’T be on the news if Australian police captured a guy with an SKS rifle who was planning jihad
