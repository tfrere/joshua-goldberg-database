Object : Junaid Thorne Information (3)

*Dear Ms Panahi,*

*Recently, I set up a fake account under the name Junaid Thorne, impersonating the Perth-based Islamic radical preacher (https://twitter.com/JunaidThorne). Immediately, Australian jihadists began to follow me and engage in conversations with me.*

*The real Junaid Thorne eventually caught on and set up a real account for himself (https://twitter.com/MJunaidThorne1). However, by impersonating Junaid, I was able to extract some very interesting information from his followers when they thought I was him. In particular, I learned that jihadists in Australia are planning to attack cartoonists Bill Leak and Larry Pickering, both of whom drew cartoons poking fun at Muhammed.*

*Here is some information that I gathered about Junaid Thorne’s followers.*

*Most of these screenshots were taken a while ago, and most of the accounts have since been suspended (ISIS accounts are CONSTANTLY suspended and then re-created).*

*As you read these screenshots, please keep in mind that I had to keep in character and act like I approved of what they were saying.*

*Some of the info that I wasn’t able to screenshot includes:*

*Some of them shared this link (which, ironically, is a neo-Nazi blog) and talked about car-bombing the place : [https://cj303addict.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/almost-all-zionist-organizations-in-australia-are-located-on-one-street/](https://cj303addict.wordpress.com/2015/01/22/almost-all-zionist-organizations-in-australia-are-located-on-one-street/) (a user called @BasimaFaysal managed to screenshot one person sharing this link, but he didn’t screenshot the car-bombing discussion)*

*Some of them talked about the Reclaim Australia rallies and suggested attacking it, but others said that it would be a waste of time because the people at the rally are all “stupid junkies” and “drunk bogans”.*
