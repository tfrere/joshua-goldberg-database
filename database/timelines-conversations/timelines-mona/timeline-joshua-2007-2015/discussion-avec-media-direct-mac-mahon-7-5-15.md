Did you finish editing that Tanya Cohen article?

**MEDIA DIRECT**

No, I think it’s shit.

It’s so poorly written it’s not worth editing.

It’s childishly bad.

Perhaps downs childish.

That’s the whole fucking point. I’m trying to get stupid, poorly-written shit on HuffPo.

You really don’t get it, do you? Tanya Cohen is a CHARACTER. She’s not a good writer. She’s a typical idiot Greens supporter.

Anyway, I knew I couldn’t rely on you, so I’m already having someone else edit it.

**MEDIA DIRECT**

Trust me - it’s you who does not get it.

**MOON METROPOLIS**

No, genius, it’s called trolling. I’m trying to make HuffPo look like a bunch of idiots by getting them to publish poorly-written garbage.
