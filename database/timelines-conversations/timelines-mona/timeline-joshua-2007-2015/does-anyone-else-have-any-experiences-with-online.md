*Does anyone else take online courses? I took them from the middle of 5th grade to the middle of 9th grade, when I started going to a public school. I went to that worthless school for half a year and for the first few weeks of the next year, before I started doing online school again. I have decided that online work is the best option for me, since it allows me to focus on my work without having to deal with America's failing public school system, America's failing public school teachers, and America's failing public school students. Although, as always, my ADHD does admittedly get in the way of accomplishing work.*
