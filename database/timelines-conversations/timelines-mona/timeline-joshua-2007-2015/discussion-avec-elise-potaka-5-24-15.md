Why don’t you just put it online on a blog or something. Or I dunno, maybe you can try call or meet in person with the editors, or skype

Or did u do that already?

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I want to reach a wide audience.

Lol. Online elsewhere is just as good for that these days

I mean, I have journalist friends who can’t get published at the moment as there’s just not much space

I know yr doing it for free, and it’s an opinion piece, but…
