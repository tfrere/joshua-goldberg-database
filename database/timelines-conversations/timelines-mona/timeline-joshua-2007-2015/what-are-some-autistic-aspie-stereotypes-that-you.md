*There are many generalizations and stereotypes about autistic and aspergers people, with many of them originating from the Internet.* (…)

*Here are some that I do not display:*

*1. I avoid anything furry like the plague.*

*2. I don't go around telling people that I have aspergers syndrome, and I certainly don't use it as an excuse to be an as*hole.*

*3. I'm not fat.*

*4. I'm not obsessed with trains or Sonic the Hedgehog.*

*5. I don't incessantly whine about NTs or "cyber-bullying".*

*6. I hate math.*

*7. I'm not bigoted or intolerant.*

*8. I don't flap my hands (although, admittedly, I do hit my hands on my ears when frustrated).*

*9. I don't draw fan art or write fanfiction.*

*10. I don't take everything literally.*

*11. I understand figurative language.*

*12. I don't create solipsistic neologisms.*

*What are some autistic/aspie stereotypes that you don't display?*

*The imagination thing is something that seems to vary from aspie to aspie. Some aspies lack imagination, but others have it in profuse amounts. I was always highly imaginative.*
