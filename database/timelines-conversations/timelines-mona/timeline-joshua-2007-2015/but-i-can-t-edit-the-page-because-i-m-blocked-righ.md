# But I can't edit the page because I'm blocked right now, and he nominated the article for deletion again only after you blocked me - because he wanted to make sure I couldn't edit the Articles for deletion page.

*It was months ago, but I'm disturbed that you continued to make these comments over a period of months, so I have to assume that you didn't really pick up any of the repeated "do not make personal attack" comments by both users. I'm also concerned that you were warned about putting reliable sources in articles, yet you have continued to create articles that lack enough sourcing to show that they pass NFILM. This is not a permanent block. It's only a couple of days. Take this time to go over the various policies and when your block is up in a few days, edit within policy and assume better faith of others. As far as what other admins have written, this block isn't about them and if you want to take them to ANI, feel free to do so. If they're accusing people of deleting articles for no good reason and saying people have Asperger's because they disagree with someone, then they deserve to get reported. I'm actually fairly surprised that neither person reported your behavior in the past, to be completely honest. What you've written was very out of line. Consider this a warning: this is the type of behavior that gets you permanently blocked. You've already had this happen twice on your userpage and both editors warned you against this. Consider this a third and final warning: continuing in this line will very likely lead to a permanent block and most certainly more temporary blocks. It's three days, not three months.*

*I also need to warn you that people have been reported to ANI for creating unsourced stubs or stubs that did not adequately show that the topic passed notability guidelines. You've created a lot of articles and from what I've seen, almost all of them have or at least had at one point, sourcing issues. With at least one of them you only provided RS once the article was threatened with deletion. You need to do this ''before'' someone does this, as again - as the article's creator you are expected and obligated to provide enough sources to assert notability. You should not expect other people to clean up after you and provide sourcing. While it's rare for someone to be permanently blocked from creating pages, there have been incidents where people have been blocked from new article creation. So far you have created fewer than 30 articles, but your edit pattern suggests that you're likely going to keep creating a massive amount of articles and as such, I want to also make sure that you're aware that you will need to provide better coverage for your articles. Do not assume that others will do this work for you or that they will have access to the same sources that you have. You have to assume that you will be the only person to provide sourcing for the article.*

*Saying that Largoplazo only nominated the article for deletion because of deletionist tendencies is hardly uncivil and is entirely valid considering that he just nominated the article for deletion ''again'', even AFTER I added more sources to it. He's clearly aiming to take advantage of the fact that I can't currently edit the Articles for deletion page to defend the article, which is patently childish and uncivil behavior.*

*For example, if I were capable of editing the Articles for deletion page that he just created, I would note that the film has been covered in all sorts of notable sources, like: (â€¦)*

*...to name just a few. I would also point out that several notable people were involved with the film, like the VERY notable [[Tuli Kupferberg]], who stars in it.*

*But I can't edit the page because I'm blocked right now, and he nominated the article for deletion again only after you blocked me - because he wanted to make sure I couldn't edit the Articles for deletion page. That kind of behavior is ''far'' more damaging to the encyclopedia than anything that I said to him.*
