On August 25, 2015, FBI agents conducted a ruse wherein they
pretended to be employees of a fictitious company that conducts surveys on community issues. After ensuring that all occupants of 3119 Pine Road except for JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG had left the residence, agents acting as employees of the fictitious company approached the residence’s front door. After knocking on the door and ringing the the doorbell, no one answered the door.
