**MOON METROPOLIS**

Have you seen the new threat from Australi Witness? Really detailed, specific stuff. He even posted a video of this jihadist friend shooting a rifle.

No. Not familiar with that.

**MOON METROPOLIS**

He’s the keyboard jihadist who inspired the shooting attempt in Garland, Texas earlier this year. He’s a huge admirer of Mariam Veiszadeh.

Thanks, I’ll have a look.

Got to be a bit careful, using my real name now.

**MOON METROPOLIS**

What do you mean?

*Sep 9*

**PETER WALLACE**

I’m using my real name, don’t want to engage the scum too much. Don’t want to be physically targeted.

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Jesus, are they really THAT pathetic?

*Sep 9*

**PETER WALLACE**

Yes they are.

Chat later, have to go.

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Alright. Take a look at the threats I linked to. They’re super explicit and I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s at least some amount of truth to them.
