*Dear Ms.Pooley*

*I frequently peruse Islamic extremist communities (along with neo-Nazi communities) and I have noticed some chatter on both of them about having Bill Leak and Larry Pickering killed.*

*Here, we have someone on 4chan’s /pol/ (a popular neo-Nazi hangout) encouraging people to contact radical Islamic groups in Australia in order to have them kill the cartoonists, which would then “increase nationalism” : http//archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/43817729/*

*The flags next to each post show which country the poster is from. This thread was apaprently posted by someone from Greenland.*

*That thread was posted numerous times, and it was also posted on 8chan several times as well. I’ve seen a new version of the thread posted almost every day. For example, it was also posted as a response to this thread : [https://archive.today/UPVSb](https://archive.today/UPVSb) (you have to scroll down at the moment.*

*Here are some additional Twitter screenshots, in which Australian jihadists talk about their plans :*

*The West Australian also forgot to include the information about jihadist ties to Amnesty International Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre. That’s some of the most shocking information I uncovered, and it definitely needs to be reported on.*
