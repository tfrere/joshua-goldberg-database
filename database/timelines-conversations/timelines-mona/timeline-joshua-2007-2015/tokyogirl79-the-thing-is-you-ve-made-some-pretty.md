# Tokyogirl79 : The thing is, you've made some pretty nasty comments towards other users and you've assumed some pretty bad faith towards other editors. Can you honestly blame me for thinking that it's likely that an IP posting even nastier comments is likely you? (â€¦)

*The thing is, you've made some pretty nasty comments towards other users and you've assumed some pretty bad faith towards other editors. Can you honestly blame me for thinking that it's likely that an IP posting even nastier comments is likely you? I've seen multiple editors get blocked for abusive behavior, only to come back and spout more abuse (along the lines of the rape and physical threats) towards their blocker - and this was not always with people I blocked, so it's not just me. (And yes, people have issued threats, insults, and other abuse on their own talk page.) This is why you need to be nicer with other editors, because if you treat others badly then we're more likely to assume that you were also the person posting nasty comments and threats on your talk page. Now you're lucky in that [[User:Cyphoidbomb|Cyphoidbomb]] is speaking in your behalf - something that they didn't have to do, considering how nasty you were towards them on your talk page. If anything, I could see them being less likely to intervene for you after you accused them of posting "passive-aggressive, aspergers-fueled messages". Since Cyphoid is a good editor I'm tempted to do it as a favor towards them, but I'm also concerned that if I do unblock you it will be just a matter of time until your behaviors get you reblocked because I don't really see where you understand where your earlier behavior was bad.
:Here's my proposal: if you can answer these questions satisfactorily then I will likely unblock you.
::#Do you understand why I blocked you in the first place?
::#Do you understand why making nasty, derogatory comments towards other editors is seen as [[WP:INCIVILITY]] and an [[WP:ADHOMINEM]] attack that is not tolerated on Wikipedia?
::#Do you understand that being abusive under your screenname will make others less likely to assume [[WP:GOODFAITH]] from you?
::#Do you understand why multiple editors have repeatedly asked you to source your articles better?
::#If unblocked, will you promise to properly source articles yourself instead of leaving the work for others to do?
::#Will you go through a training program like [[WP:ADVENTURE]] or [[WP:TRAINING]] so you can refresh yourself on the importance of asserting notability for articles and collaboration?
:The last one is not mandatory, but I think that it would be a good idea given that you have shown such awful behavior towards other editors and you've made so many articles that had issues with notability and sourcing. Basically, while Cyphoid is speaking on your behalf, I just get a strong feeling that unless you can actively start trying to get along with other editors (along with properly sourcing and completing your articles), you're just eventually going to be re-blocked from editing. There's no reason for you to make the comments that you have here. This is not a place where it's OK for you to say the things you have here. Now I'm not looking for you to turn all happy-dappy "let's hold hands and sing Kumbaya", but I do want to ensure that if I ''do'' unblock you that you're not going to make more derogatory comments about Asperger or openly accuse a long running editor of being a deletionist because you couldn't be bothered to find sources for an article. I need to make sure that you can, at the very least, properly function and interact with other editors.*
