# Tokyogirl79 : I've made the block permanent now, since your comments pretty much show that you'd have continued this harassment when the block was up. All you had to do was wait out the block and then start contributing in a more positive manner where you treat other editors with respect and read over guidelines a little better. You showing that you are unwilling to do this and stating that you wanted me (I assume it's me, since the other two editors were male) to undergo physical and sexual violence because I blocked you was probably one of the most unwise things you could have done.
