“I reviewed communications from FBI employee(s) whom conducted
physical surveillance of 3119 Pine Road, Orang Park, Florida 32065 on August 22 and 23, 2015. Based on their observations and descriptions, Idetermined that F. Goldberg and R. Goldberg were observed at this address. Two male minor children of elementary
school age were also observed by FBI employee(s) and are believed to be living at the
residence.
I communicated with FBI employee(s) regarding attempts to identify
JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG at 3119 Pine Road. I was advised of the following:

a.Since August 20, 2015 the FBI has been conducting surveillance of the PREMISES.
b. On or about August 24, 2015, FBI employees observed all other
persons identified as residing at 3119 Pine Road, except JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG, leave the residence. Thereafter, FBI employees observed the shadow of a person moving around the inside of the residence. They also observed a light in the vicinity of
the front door turn on. The FBI employees were unable to observe anything beyond the shadow.
c. On August 25, 2015, FBI agents conducted a ruse wherein they
pretended to be employees of a fictitious company that conducts surveys on community issues. After ensuring that all occupants of 3119 Pine Road except for JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG had left the residence, agents acting as employees of the fictitious company approached the residence’s front door. After knocking on the doorbell, no one answered the door.

d. On or about August 27, 2015, FBI employees observed
F. G. and R. G. leave 3119 Pine Road. Thereafter, FBI employees observed the shadow of a person moving around the inside of the residence. They also observed a light at the residence turn off. The FBI employees were unable to observe anything beyond the shadow.
e. On or about September 3, 2015, FBI employees observed all
residents of 3119 Pine Road except for JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG leave the residence. Thereafter, FBI employees observed the shadow of a person moving around
the inside of the residence. The FBI employees were unable to observe anything beyond the shadow.
f. On or about September 8, 2015, FBI employees observed all
residents of 3119 Pine Road except for JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG leave the residence. Thereafter, at approximately 9:00 A.M. FBI employees observed an unknown male exit a van and approach the front door of the residence. Shortly thereafter, FBI
employees observed who they believe is JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG and talk with the unidentified male.
open the door After a brief conversation, the unidentified male
accompanied JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG
into the residence. Shortly thereafter, the
unidentified male exited the residence unaccompanied by JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG. The unidentified male then talks with someone in the van. A second vehicle parks at 3119 Pine Road and another unidentified male exits his vehicle. Three unidentified males then enter through the front door of the residence and the garage
door to the residence opens a short time later. Based on the observations and descriptions of the FBI employee(s) conducting surveillance, it appears the three unidentified males are involved with a home construction and / or repair project at 3119
Pine Road.

I was advised by an FBI employee that between August 26 and 27, 2015, FBI agents in the Tampa Division determined that D.Goldberg, the sister of JOSHUA RYNE GOLDBERG,
is a recently enrolled full-time student in the fall semester at a
college in south Florida and that law enforcement saw her on the campus on August 27, 2015.
