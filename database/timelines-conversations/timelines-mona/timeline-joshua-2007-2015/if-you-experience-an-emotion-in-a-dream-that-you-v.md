*If You Experience An Emotion In A Dream...*

*...that you've never experienced in real life, would you consider it a real emotion that you are capable of feeling in real life, or just something that your subconscious mind created, that has no basis in reality? Do you think it would be possible to feel an entirely new emotion in a dream; one that no one has ever felt - or could possibly feel - in real life?*
