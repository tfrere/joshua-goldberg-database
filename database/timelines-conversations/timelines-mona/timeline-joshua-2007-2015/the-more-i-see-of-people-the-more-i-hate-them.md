*I can relate to a lot of what you said. But, the more I see of people, the more I hate them. The chances of me ever maintaining a friendship are pretty much zero.*

**Troy_Guther wrote:**

*That's probably because you just haven't met enough awesome people yet.*

**MoonMetropolis wrote:**

*Yes, but, even if I like someone, there is pretty much a 99% chance that I will end up disliking them at some point, for whatever reason. And, even if I still like them, I don't ever want to see someone again after I see them once.*

**Troy_Guther wrote:**

*Do you want it to be like that? Does it feel like it's out of your control?*

**MoonMetropolis wrote:**

*Well, at this point, it doesn't really matter. But yes, I do feel it is out of my control.*
