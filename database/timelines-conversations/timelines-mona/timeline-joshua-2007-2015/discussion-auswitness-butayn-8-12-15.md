Well, the thing is, I am very afraid that something may have happened to him. He seems to have completely disappeared. We were very close to carrying out this attack, but now he's gone and I cannot contact him.

If he's been caught then we must ask Allah to free him

 If the kuffar captured him, it would be ail over the news, wouldn't it?
