**MEDIA DIRECT**

can I ask, just out of curiosity, what motivates this activity?

I ask because, I myself have a long long history of doing shit - and I’m fairly clear about why I do it… you, i’m confused.

White power is kind of gay.

White supremacists are useful idiots for me. Again, I also pretend to be a SJW on some accounts.
