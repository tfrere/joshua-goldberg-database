*A guy called HasanAlilS made similar Tweets and also claimed to know Mariam Veiszadeh : https://twitter.com/TheArbiter1/status/571957841390522368*

*A guy called Hasan Ali also made a post on the Islamic Awakening forums about Bill Leak, but those forums have since been taken down, so I can’t link you to. There’s a chance the board might come back up, though.*
