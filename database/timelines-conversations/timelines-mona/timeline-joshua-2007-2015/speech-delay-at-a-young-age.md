*I have not been officially diagnosed with aspergers, but a psychologist told me that people with autism typically have speech delays at a young age. I never had speech delays. Quite the opposite, in fact. I was very much ahead in terms of speech. Does this mean that I for sure am not an aspie? I had plenty of other aspie-like behaviors, though, such as tactile issues. And, in addition, I display every other symptom of aspergers in the extreme.*
