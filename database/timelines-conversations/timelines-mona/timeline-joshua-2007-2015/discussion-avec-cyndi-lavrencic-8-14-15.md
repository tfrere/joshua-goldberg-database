Can I ask where you first heard about the 8chan threat?

I only knew about it because of a thread about it made on another 8chan board.

Any other screen shots or things relating to him?

I had the link sent to me by a friend - I think it was linked to him

8chan’s Transparency Report comes out on the [18th. In](http://18th.In) the report, they’ll reveal if any governments asked them for IP addresses…

…and, if so on which boards the IP addresses were requested for, i’d be very surprised if governments didn’t request the IP of that post.

I haven’t seen anything else from him, but I’m almost, 100% certain this is his account: @aussecret
