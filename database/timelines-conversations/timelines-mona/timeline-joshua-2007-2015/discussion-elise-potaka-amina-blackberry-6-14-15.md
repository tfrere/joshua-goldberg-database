Hi Amina, I’m an Australian journalist. Just have a question I wanted to ask you about the Aussie IS supporter “Australi Witness”

**AMINA BLACKBERRY**

What’s your question?

**ELISE POTAKA**

I saw you’re interested in him and follow what he’s up to. Where did u find out about his blog from?

*Jun 14*

I’m trying to keep on top of everything he does, but it’s hard to keep tabs on him

I was looking through here: archive.is/justpaste.it

I noticed it among the pages that had been archived.

Justpaste is used almost exclusively by jihadist types.

I often check [archive.is](http://archive.is) for the newly-archived jihadist documents.

Oh yeah, I hadn’t thought of doing that. That’s a good way to do it

Do you have a particular interest in him? Know anything else about him?

**AMINA BLACKBERRY**

I don’t know much about him, but I had read about him in the past. Do you

I’m not sure, just have some vague details. But hoping to write an article about him soon.

So strange that news of him reaches you all the way in the US!

*Jun 14*

**AMINA BLACKBERRY**

The news covered him inspiring the attack in Texas.

Do you think his new threat is legit?

*Jun 14*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Oh yeah, that makes sense, I have no idea if his threats are real, I hope not

Please let me know if you see anything else by him!

*Jun 14*

**AMINA BLACKBERRY**

Alright, I’ll tell you.

What will happen if his threat turns out to be real? I imagine it would cause quite a shitstorm.

*Jun 14*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Yeah I guess it would. He’s certainly very blatant
