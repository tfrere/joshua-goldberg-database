### **09/08/2011, 12:37 am : I Hate My Generation**

*It would be impossible for me to adequately summarize the sheer, overpowering amount of hatred and contempt I have for my generation (teenagers and "young adults"). While it's true that I do hate humans in general, I have a special hatred for 99.9% of teenagers and such.* (â€¦)

*This is the Internet generation, after all. People view graphic videos of rapes and murders every day, giggle at them, and then pass them along to their friends. Any sense of dignity or humanity we once had has long since been completely eradicated. As the Internet has shown us, we are nothing but savage and depraved animals. People reveal things about themselves on the Internet that they wouldn't even dream of revealing to anyone in real life - not even to a therapist. When people are anonymous and they don't have to accept responsibility for their actions, they will simply do as they please. This is why the Internet is such a portal into the darkest depths of human degeneracy. It completely depersonalizes us and allows us to view other people as nothing more than objects. Ultimately, it will be the downfall of our civilization. The thought of these sex-obsessed, hedonistic, chauvinistic, solipsistic, materialistic, superficial, brutish, uneducated troglodytes one day attempting to run the world is beyond terrifying. It makes me scared for the future of mankind. I mean, how do these idiots even dress themselves? All they know is violence, debasing sex, drugs, petty crime, fast food, mindless debauchery, and MTV. That is our culture.*

*And no, I am not going to "shoot up schools" or kill anyone, so don't even start with that crap. Seriously.*
