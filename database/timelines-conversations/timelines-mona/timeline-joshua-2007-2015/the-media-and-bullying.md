*I love how the media sensationalizes bullying and acts like it's some new teen trend. Bullying has always been around and it always will be around.*

*Teenagers are cruel, petty, ignorant pieces of s**t. In fact, many adults are too.*

*This generation is absolutely vile and disgusting. But perhaps we should focus less on this "cyberbullying" nonsense and focus more on people who are ACTUALLY being beaten bloody and abused by REAL bullies, not just stupid online gossiping and name-calling. Just a thought.*

*I mean, really. If you are going to kill yourself because someone said a few mean things about you online, then clearly something was wrong with you to begin with and you obviously were completely sheltered and unprepared for life in the real world. That's really the epitome of over-sensitive.*

*How could anyone possibly handle reality when they can't even handle some mean people online?*

*This is going to sound awful, but bullying actually helps some people in a way. Those of us who are tough enough to take it without committing suicide often end up stronger for it. Sometimes, we develop paranoid social disorders, but who's to say I wouldn't be this way anyway?*

*Plus, most bullies grow up to be failures, and we survivors look forward to the day when we see our former enemies on the street begging for change.*

*And, when they stop us and ask for help, we'll just stand there laughing at them as they pick up the handful of pennies we threw at their feet. It is always truly delightful to watch your enemies crumble.*

*My point? The media will exploit anything to make a quick buck. The media is the ultimate bully.*
