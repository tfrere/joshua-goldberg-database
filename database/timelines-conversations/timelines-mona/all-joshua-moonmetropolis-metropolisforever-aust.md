**MoonMetropolis wrote :**

*I have not been officially diagnosed with aspergers, but a psychologist told me that people with autism typically have speech delays at a young age. I never had speech delays. Quite the opposite, in fact. I was very much ahead in terms of speech. Does this mean that I for sure am not an aspie? I had plenty of other aspie-like behaviors, though, such as tactile issues. And, in addition, I display every other symptom of aspergers in the extreme.*

*Does anyone else take online courses? I took them from the middle of 5th grade to the middle of 9th grade, when I started going to a public school. I went to that worthless school for half a year and for the first few weeks of the next year, before I started doing online school again. I have decided that online work is the best option for me, since it allows me to focus on my work without having to deal with America's failing public school system, America's failing public school teachers, and America's failing public school students. Although, as always, my ADHD does admittedly get in the way of accomplishing work.*

### **09/08/2011, 12:37 am : I Hate My Generation**

*It would be impossible for me to adequately summarize the sheer, overpowering amount of hatred and contempt I have for my generation (teenagers and "young adults"). While it's true that I do hate humans in general, I have a special hatred for 99.9% of teenagers and such.* (…)

*This is the Internet generation, after all. People view graphic videos of rapes and murders every day, giggle at them, and then pass them along to their friends. Any sense of dignity or humanity we once had has long since been completely eradicated. As the Internet has shown us, we are nothing but savage and depraved animals. People reveal things about themselves on the Internet that they wouldn't even dream of revealing to anyone in real life - not even to a therapist. When people are anonymous and they don't have to accept responsibility for their actions, they will simply do as they please. This is why the Internet is such a portal into the darkest depths of human degeneracy. It completely depersonalizes us and allows us to view other people as nothing more than objects. Ultimately, it will be the downfall of our civilization. The thought of these sex-obsessed, hedonistic, chauvinistic, solipsistic, materialistic, superficial, brutish, uneducated troglodytes one day attempting to run the world is beyond terrifying. It makes me scared for the future of mankind. I mean, how do these idiots even dress themselves? All they know is violence, debasing sex, drugs, petty crime, fast food, mindless debauchery, and MTV. That is our culture.*

*And no, I am not going to "shoot up schools" or kill anyone, so don't even start with that crap. Seriously.*

*I love how the media sensationalizes bullying and acts like it's some new teen trend. Bullying has always been around and it always will be around.*

*Teenagers are cruel, petty, ignorant pieces of s**t. In fact, many adults are too.*

*This generation is absolutely vile and disgusting. But perhaps we should focus less on this "cyberbullying" nonsense and focus more on people who are ACTUALLY being beaten bloody and abused by REAL bullies, not just stupid online gossiping and name-calling. Just a thought.*

*I mean, really. If you are going to kill yourself because someone said a few mean things about you online, then clearly something was wrong with you to begin with and you obviously were completely sheltered and unprepared for life in the real world. That's really the epitome of over-sensitive.*

*How could anyone possibly handle reality when they can't even handle some mean people online?*

*This is going to sound awful, but bullying actually helps some people in a way. Those of us who are tough enough to take it without committing suicide often end up stronger for it. Sometimes, we develop paranoid social disorders, but who's to say I wouldn't be this way anyway?*

*Plus, most bullies grow up to be failures, and we survivors look forward to the day when we see our former enemies on the street begging for change.*

*And, when they stop us and ask for help, we'll just stand there laughing at them as they pick up the handful of pennies we threw at their feet. It is always truly delightful to watch your enemies crumble.*

*My point? The media will exploit anything to make a quick buck. The media is the ultimate bully.*

*Do people notice there's something "odd" about you? Are you able to conceal your aspie-ness? And, most importantly, do you care?*

*I could act "normal" if I wanted to, but why should I change myself to seek the approval of others? Hell, I don't even WANT the approval of others.*

*I used to act like a total clown and flaunt my intelligence because, I suppose, I simply didn't know how to act. I would sing and dance and generally make a buffoon of myself so people would think I was cool. Looking back, it simply makes me cringe.*

*Nowadays, I am very cold and distant, especially with strangers. The more respect I have for someone, the less likely I am to talk to them. This is because I know I'll say something wrong and ruin it -- or perhaps they'll say something wrong, and I'll lose respect for them. I have been told many, many times that I lack basic social skills. But, the thing is, I really couldn't care less.*

We meet again!

*Apr 15*

Can I ask u something?

*Apr 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I suppose so.

*Apr 15*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Was it you on Facebook the other day? I’m not out to judge

Just curious

*Apr 15*

Maybe I got it wrong?

But yr anti ISIS right?

*Apr 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Yes, it was me on Facebook pretending to be you. And yes, I am anti-ISIS.

*Apr 15*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Ok. Can I ask what’s yr interest in Junaid Thorne?

*Apr 15*

Aren’t u in the US?

*Apr 15*

I should say I’m not friends with Junaid, have just interviewed him before

*Apr 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I am interested ub extremist movements. Also, I gathered some information from Junaid’s followers.

They are planning a Charlie Hebdo-style attack on Australian cartoonists Bill Leak and Larry Pickering.

They have the addresses of both cartoonists.

*Apr 15*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Sorry I was just sleeping. They told u they want to carry out an attack?

Have u told relevant authorities in Australia?

*Apr 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

No, I haven’t told any authorities about it. I live in the US.

*Apr 16*

**ELISE POTAKA**

How serious did they sound in terms of targeting Leak and Pickering? Or was it just roundabout talk

Can I ask, how did u instigate those conversations with them?

*Apr 16*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I can send you some screenshots via email if you’d like me to.

But, first, you have to tell Junaid that I had nothing to do with the Twitter account & that you made a mistake.

*Apr 16*

Can I ask, what do u hope to do with all the info u get?

*Apr 16*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Another journalist asked me for the info to use as part of a story, so I emailed it to him.

*Apr 16*

*Apr 16*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Has anyone threatened u?

*Apr 16*

Can u send me screengrab of grant Taylor talking about me?

*Apr 16*

Btw I’ve also worked for BBC, DW, SBS, ABC, Sydney morning herald, global mail, Agence France Presse

*Apr 16*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Not yet, but I fully expect to start receiving threats.

And I think he would get mad at me if I did, I don’t want to start flights.

*Apr 16*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Tbh I think Junaid is someone who just influences through words, not sure he would really bother, or be organised enough, to do anything

That’s just my reading of him

My email address is elise.potakaosborne@gmail.com

Hope u can also send me the grabs

*Dear Mr. Taylor,*

*I frequently persude Islamic extremist communities (along with neo-Nazi communities) and I have noticed some chatter on both of them about having Bill Leak and Larry pickering killed.*

*Here, we have someone on 4chan’s /pol/ (a popular neo-Nazi* *hangout) encouraging people to contact radical Islamic groups in Australia in order to have them kill the cartoonists, which would then “increase nationalism” : http//archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/43817729/*

*The flags next to each post show which country the poster is from. This thread was apaprently posted by someone from Greenland.*

*That thread was posted numerous times, and it was also posted on 8chan several times as well. I’ve seen a new version of the thread posted almost every day. For example, it was also posted as a response to this thread : [https://archive.today/UPVSb](https://archive.today/UPVSb) (you have to scroll  down quite a lot to find it)*

*There was a thread on Islamic Awakening about Bill Leak, but that site is down at the moment.*

*As for the article that you wrote, it should be updated.*

*It wasn’t IslamicStateAU who said that they were gonna have Leak and Pickering killed. It was someone called ShamiWitness. There “ShamiWitness”, as a quick search reveals.*

*The Hasan Ali IS guy was talking to a Reclaim Australia supporter named Nathan Sykes (since suspended as well) when he said that he would conquer Australia.*

*You should also DEFINITELY mention the connections with Amnesty International Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre. That’s very important information.*

Object : Junaid Thorne Information 

*Dear Mr.Minear,*

*Recently, I set up a fake account under the name Junaid Thorne, impersonating the Perth-based Islamic radical preacher (https://twitter.com/JunaidThorne). Immediately, Australian jihadists began to follow me and engage in conversations with me.*

*The real Junaid Thorne eventually caught on and set up a real account for himself (https://twitter.com/MJunaidThorne1). However, by impersonating Junaid, I was able to extract some very interesting information from his followers when they thought I was him. In particular, I learned that jihadists in Australia are planning to attack cartoonists Bill Leak and Larry Pickering, both of whom drew cartoons poking fun at Muhammed.*

*Here is some information that I gathered about Junaid Thorne’s followers.*

*Most of these screenshots were taken a while ago, and most of the accounts have since been suspended (ISIS accounts are CONSTANTLY suspended and then re-created).*

*As you read these screenshots, please keep in mind that I had to keep in character and act like I approved of what they were saying.*

**GRANT TAYLOR**

Yeah sorry, been a bit crook last couple of days. I have forwarded it to AFP.

Did you detect a note of sarcasm in the original neoNazi post?

It is hard to tell if they are being serious or joking. No doubt the ithough that dea spread pretty quickly to others who may not have seen

the joke. not really sure what to male of it to be honest. You? 

*Apr 20*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

To be honest, if it were a joke, I don’t think they would have posted it so many times & included links to real Islamic extremist groups.

The same post was made over and over and over again, all of them by someone from Greenland.

If it were a joke, I don’t see why they would be so eager to repost it… unless they actually did want people to carry out the instructions.

Do you plan to update the article, though?

I mean, to fix the error and to add the information about the jihadists working with “human rights” groups.

*Apr 20*

**GRANT TAYLOR**

I did ask for it to be changed but it had already been replaced on the website by the terror raids in Melbourne. Again junaid links.

You are probably right re the Neo nazi post. The intent is clearly to plant a seed in someone’s head.

*Apr 20*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

I’m still having discussions with jihadists on the account. Can I send you some more info so you can write a new article…

…and include the info about “human rights” groups in it?

Aside from the planned attacks on Leak&Pickening, there’s been some chatter about attacking Anzac Day parades, esp. in Sydney & Melbourne.

*Apr 22*

**CYNDI LAVRENCIC**

Is that recent? A number of people were arrested over the weekend in relation to a planned attack

*Apr 22*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

It’s been going on for a few days now. It’s still ongoing.

Could you send me some of the newer screenshots? I can forward them without your contact. Unless you wanted to report yourself?

Hold on, let me see if I can find some of the conversations.

*Apr 22*

Here’s a thread on 8chan’s /islam/ board about attacking Anzac Day: archive.is/1ju74. Flags by the posts : the posters’ locations.

Note how the Australian posters have different IDs, meaning they’re different people.

**CYNDI LAVRENCIC**

Right right. Posted today. Thanks for that - let me know if anything else comes up

No problem.

Will you be posting an article this Saturday? Or have you abandoned the article altogether?

Interesting. Are these followers of your other account or do you come across them?

The former follows my Junaid account. The latter doesn’t, but I think my Junaid account follows him.

Has anyone messaged you after finding out Junaid has a separate account?

My account still gets messages, but I haven’t gotten any regarding the separate account. Just tweets about it.

Object : Junaid Thorne Information (3)

*Dear Ms Panahi,*

*Recently, I set up a fake account under the name Junaid Thorne, impersonating the Perth-based Islamic radical preacher (https://twitter.com/JunaidThorne). Immediately, Australian jihadists began to follow me and engage in conversations with me.*

*The real Junaid Thorne eventually caught on and set up a real account for himself (https://twitter.com/MJunaidThorne1). However, by impersonating Junaid, I was able to extract some very interesting information from his followers when they thought I was him. In particular, I learned that jihadists in Australia are planning to attack cartoonists Bill Leak and Larry Pickering, both of whom drew cartoons poking fun at Muhammed.*

*Here is some information that I gathered about Junaid Thorne’s followers.*

*Most of these screenshots were taken a while ago, and most of the accounts have since been suspended (ISIS accounts are CONSTANTLY suspended and then re-created).*

*As you read these screenshots, please keep in mind that I had to keep in character and act like I approved of what they were saying.*

*Some of them talked about the Reclaim Australia rallies and suggested attacking it, but others said that it would be a waste of time because the people at the rally are all “stupid junkies” and “drunk bogans”.*

*Dear Ms.Pooley*

*I frequently peruse Islamic extremist communities (along with neo-Nazi communities) and I have noticed some chatter on both of them about having Bill Leak and Larry Pickering killed.*

*Here, we have someone on 4chan’s /pol/ (a popular neo-Nazi hangout) encouraging people to contact radical Islamic groups in Australia in order to have them kill the cartoonists, which would then “increase nationalism” : http//archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/43817729/*

*The flags next to each post show which country the poster is from. This thread was apaprently posted by someone from Greenland.*

*That thread was posted numerous times, and it was also posted on 8chan several times as well. I’ve seen a new version of the thread posted almost every day. For example, it was also posted as a response to this thread : [https://archive.today/UPVSb](https://archive.today/UPVSb) (you have to scroll down at the moment.*

*http://i.imgur.com/n5aP9JL.png*

*The West Australian also forgot to include the information about jihadist ties to Amnesty International Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre. That’s some of the most shocking information I uncovered, and it definitely needs to be reported on.*

*When did you set up the account and why did you choose to do it? I’d also be interested to know whether you’d shared this information with the authorities anywhere.*

*Dear Mr. Minear,*

*I believe this account was created on April 9th. I set it up to see what kibd of reactions I would get, particularly from Junaid’s followers. I used the account to collect information on them, and it was easy to do because they thought I was him.*

*There are many, many profiles and conversations. What kind of information would you like me to provide you with?*

*Someone else shared some of the information with Australian authorities.*

*Interesting stuff. Did you have any communications with the teens recently arrestation over the Anzac Day terror plot? Some of their names are Sevdet Besim, Harun (…) Safi, Mehran Azami and Eathan Cruse.*

*I suppose most of the profiles didn’t have people’s real identities on them but (…) that jumped out to you?*

*I’d probably be interested in a lot of what you collected - how about anything related with attacks in Australia?*

*Or people who Australia for Syria/Iraq?*

*May I ask what information in particular was shared with authorities?*

*Thanks for your help.*

*Dear Mr.Minear,*

*I’m not sure if I had any contact with them, but I did have contact with some people talking about attacking Anzac Day. Here is one such thread: [https://archive.is/cEmZy](https://archive.is/cEmZyThe)*

*The Twitter user @AusWitness2 posted the locations of several Anzac Day parades and implicitly encouraged attacks on them, but nothing ever happened.*

*The Twitter user @mjm1436 left Australia to fight with ISIS in Syria: https://twitter.com/mjm1436*

*Most of the chatter has revolved around having Bill Leak and Larry Pickering killed. Some of that info is what was shared with the Australian federal police.*

*The name Hasan Ali (sometimes spelled Hassan Ali) has appeared a few times. Someone called Hasan Ali posted a message on the Islamic Awakening forums (a popular jihadist hangout which is down at the moment) about Bill Leak.*

*Also be interested to know if there’s been much about Musa Cerantonio?*

*Cheers.*

Hello, this is Australi Witness. You might know me for inspiring the attacks in Garland, Texas, where two mujahideen entered an event mocking the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) with intent to slaughter the kuffar in it. When I encouraged the attacks in Texas, my biggest inspiration was the Australian Muslim human rights activist Mariam Veiszadeh, who has worked tirelessly and diligently to outlaw blasphemy against Islam in Australia. Any true Muslim knows that blasphemy against the Prophets of Allah (SWT) is a capital crime which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances, and Mariam Veiszadeh's work has provided me with a great deal of inspiration. All who defame the Prophet (PBUH) must be crushed. Bill Leak and Larry Pickering will soon meet their demise, as will Josh Bornstein.

Recently, I have met two mujahideen online - one in Los Angeles and one in Melbourne - and I have successfully encouraged them to carry out jihad in their respective cities. Both of these mujahideen will, using guns, shoot up local synagogues when the maximum amount of Jews are praying. The entire thing was my idea, and I helped them every step of the way. I gave them the idea in the first place, I pointed them to local synagogues, I provided them with copious amounts of encouragement, and I helped them coordinate the attacks. All of this was done over the Internet.

For those wondering about me: I currently live in Perth. I came to Australia as a refugee from Lebanon, and my parents are coconuts who have no idea of my involvement with jihad.

For many years, I worked at Amnesty International Australia. In my last year working at Amnesty, I met some Muslim brothers who introduced me to the Islamic State. I was immediately enamoured with the Islamic State's ideology, and I quickly became a mujahid. After becoming a mujahid, I have dedicated my life to striking fear into the hearts of the kuffar and coordinating acts of jihad around the world.

I cannot disclose where I currently work, but it is a respected human rights organisation much like Amnesty. I present myself as a moderate in real life, and the police have absolutely no idea who I am. I am widely upheld as a pillar of my community, and nobody would EVER suspect me for anything. You have no chance of finding me.

To the Australian government: you will pay for your new anti-Muslim laws stripping Islamic State mujahideen of their Australian citizenship. These laws are a grievous attack on the basic human rights of Muslims. Expect many more acts of jihad to occur on Australian shores for as long as you continue to strip Muslim Australians of their fundamental human rights.

To the Jews: you killed the Rasul (SAW) and he died a Shaheed. Any Muslim who truly loves the Prophet (PBUH) will engage in jihad against Jews in order to avenge his death. The Jews are the worst enemies of Allah (SWT). When Islam conquers Australia, every single Jew will be slaughtered like the filthy cockroaches that they are.

Finally, I would like to state with absolute authority that Islam is most definitely NOT a religion of peace. Islam is a religion of violent conquest. And, rest assured, Australia: Islam WILL conquer your nation. As a matter of fact, it is already happening. Your churches are becoming mosques, your food is becoming halal, your women are having our babies, and your laws are becoming sharia. Australia's defeat at the hands of Islam is inevitable. The more you try to fight it, the harder it will be for you. Give up and accept your future as an Islamic nation - a member of the global Islamic caliphate that the Islamic State will create, Allah (SWT) willing.

I have a vast network of mujahideen around the world, and I will continue to inspire and coordinate jihad attacks around the world. There is absolutely nothing that you can do to stop me. I am an expert in computer security who uses multiple proxies, and I am also an expert in Australian law due to my extensive work with human rights organisations. Chase me all you want, but you will never find me, and you will also never stop the wrath of Allah (SWT) on the decadent West.

Perish in your rage, kuffar!

He’d probably just respond with something about Twitter being run by kuffar.

BTW, if ISIS attacks London, it will probably be today.

*May 15*

Friday is the day when the largest amount of Muslims are praying in mosques. Today would be the day that ISIS would shoot up a mail.

They’ve been threatening to do it all week with their #LondonAttack Tweets.

*May 15*

It could just be keyboard warrior bullshit, but those threats were much more specific than the usual “hurka we will kill the infidels”

Two of them posted pictures of their guns and bombs for an imminent London attack, and some others talked about attacking a shopping mall.

*May 15*

**ELISE POTAKA**

Why would they do Friday? That’s the least likely day surely

Given prayers etc

*May 15*

**MOON METROPOLIS**

Because that’s the day when the most amount of Muslims are praying, so, in a shooting, they’d kill the most non-Muslims & the least Muslims.

Make sure they include the part where the local Islamic leader says this :

“Everybody has a right to be a bigot. Everybody has a right to be a racist. Everybody has a right to be an idiot.”

Australians would be absolutely stunned by a minority person saying that.

**AFP Federal Agent (mohamadmo7)**

good to see you back on here brother! the kuffar wouldn’t have a clue! :P

**AusWitness**

lndeed, brother. The kuffar have no ldea about this account. They are powerless to stop me.

**AFP Federal Agent**

for me your posts were quite interesting. my parents moved to Australia before i was born and adopted the western way. i hate them for this.

**AusWitness**

Yes, my parents are coconuts as well. They would be very angry if they knew I was a mujahid, as
they support the Western kaflr governments.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i like the coconut reference brother! my parents are from Egypt and forced me to grow up on a western kafir lifestyle!

I have to learn islam on my own!

but same with me, they don’t know how i feel and would kill me. any help is appreciated brother =)

**AusWitness**

I grew up the same way, brother. My parents are frorn Lebanon, and they raised me to be a kafir. I
had to learn real Islam on my own.

Is there anything I can help you with, brother? l live in Perth.

**AFP Federal Agent**

exactly the same way. i have grown up with western kafir brainwash and i can see this now as i get
older,

i guess for me I want lo reclaim my Islamic heritage which was stolen from me

you know?         

    

any good sites to read etc?

im in Melbourne by the way

**AusWitness**      '

I understand completely, brother. I have dedicated my life to serving real Islam, and no kafir is
ever going to stop me.

Here is one·of the best Islamic blogs: .ansarukhilafah wordpress corn

Here is a very helpful guide for making hijrah to the Islamic State: .ia801509 us.arcl,ive
org/9/iterns/Hijrah

**AFP Federal Agent**

thank you for the information brother! I’ll have a read of those - have you ever thought of making hijrah to the Islamic State?

**AusWitness**     

Yes, but I believe that it would be better if both of us carry out jihad on Australian shores. Do
you have a gun, brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

sorry brother haven’t checked my twitter, your wordpress is very informative, i haven’t really thought about carrying out a jihad here

what have you got ln mind?? i don't have a gun but my brother's friend ara pretty shadey characters - maybe they have one haha

are you all good brother?? i thought the kuffar may have shut this down too! inshallah 

**AusWitness**

I am good, brother. Sorry for the delay. And we need to carry out jihad against Jews. There are
many synagogues in Melbourne to target.

**AFP Federal Agent**

I am interested but, want to do it right. i don't even know how to start organising something like
this. what are you planning brother?

**AusWitness**

When I get a gun, I plan to at attack a mosque in Perth. All you need is to find a crowded synagogue
with minimal guards & open fire.

Here are the synagogues in Melbourne: .maven [co.il/synagogues/C33](http://co.il/synagogues/C33)...  Go to one & shoot as many
Jews as you can, brother. Jews are the worst kuffar.

**AFP Federal Agent**

brother, i think you mean a synagogue not a mosque….

do you think something like this would be have a greater impact if we were to coordinate it at the same time ?

multiple attacks like this will surely strike fear into the hearts of the kuffar. inshallah

brother, is it safe to have these conversations on twitter?

i am scared of being caught before i carry out jihad like my other brothers here in Melbourne

**AusWitness**

Yes, I meant a synagogue. Sorry, brother. And yes, it is safe. The kuffar don't know about this
account.

I agree, we should wage jihad around the same time. When do you think the right lime would be? I
think we should do it this month.

Will you be able to get a gun soon, brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

i haven’t heard from you for a long time brother, i was getting worried. what has been happening with you?

I have sourced some guns from my brother's friend i was telling you about. he has sent me a link to
some photos of the guns on photo bucket

i have had a look at them but I do not know what i am looking at. one of them is a shotgun and the
other is an SKS rifle??

do you know about guns? l do not know anything, please provide me with some advice brother about
which one would  be more suitable.

here is the link to the photos bit.ly/1FAgvEg

my friend wants $300 for the shotgun and $1000 for the rifle

to be a shaheed i have to repay my debts before i do this.

i have a car that i can sell that might be worth $2000 but i have some debts to settle with my family before i do this.

i am sorry brother. have you been able to get a gun?

**AusWitness**

The SKS rifle would be better for killing the maximum amount of kuffar.

I am sorry, but I have very little money at the moment. I can barely even pay for my Internet.
That's why it keeps going out.

Once I can get the money, I will buy a gun and kill Jews in Perth.

**AFP Federal Agent**

is it possible to chat with you at a time when we are both online? i have many questions for you brother and no one to answer them.

do you know others that have been a martyr and carried out the will of god and ascended to paradise?

**AusWitness**

If you like, we can meet on IRC.

Yes, I know many martyrs, brother. I actually inspired the two mujahideen in Texas: s11111 co111
au/federal-politi

**AFP Federal Agent**

You were talking with those two shaheeds?

IRC? what is that?

**AusWitness**

Yes, brother. I inspired both of them to carry out their attacks. I even tweeted out a map to the
location of the anti­ lslam event.

IRC is a chatroom thing.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have not used it before. what about Skype?

have you thought about your plans for jihad in detail?

**AusWitness**

IRC is much easier, brother. and it's lotally anonymous. And yes, I have. I plan to shoot up a
local synagogue in Perth.

I only have a few minutes of battery left on my laptop at the moment.

**AFP Federal Agent**

maybe we can chat at this time on IRC then tomottow night brother?

**AusWitness**

Yes, I will try to do that. We can talk about our plans there. Goodnight, brother.

**AFP Federal Agent**

goodnight my friend

**AusWitness**

Tomorrow around 9:30 PM, right?

**AFP Federal Agent**

pm ok?

**AusWitness**

Yes, that sounds okay.

NEXT DAY

**AusWitness**

Are you there, brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes brother i am here

how are you?

**AusWitness**

I am fine. Would you like to speak to me on IRC now?

**AFP Federal Agent**

is it ok for us to continue to talk on twitter?

i did some research on IRC and I amusing a mac. IRC will not work on a mac, is that right?

**AusWitness**

It should work if you connect online. Go here: .k1wiirc com/cl1en

Sorry, wrong link. Here: .kiwiirc corn/client Ünder Nickname, put mohamadmo7. Under Channel, put
#mohamadrno. Then click "Start".

**AFP Federal Agent**

ok hold on a minute, stay on twiller as well in case i cannot get it to work. sorry i am not very
technical with computers.

**AusWitness**

Il looks like it's not letting me use proxies on it. I think we should just keep talking on here
for now.

**AFP Federal Agent**

ok. what is a proxy, is that like TOR?

**AusWitness**

Yes. Proxies hide your location. lt won’t let me use Tor or proxies.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i want to talk to you about jihad

**AusWitness**

I would like to talk about jihad as well.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have told you that this has been something that i have been thinking about for a long time now, i just don’t know what to do.

**AusWitness**

Now is the time for jihad, brother. Allah (SWT) commands us to strike fear into the hearts of the
kuffar.

Remember that the Jews killed the Rasul (SAW) & he died as a shaheed.

If we really love the Prophet (PBUH), we must carry out jihad against Jews to avenge his death.

**AFP Federal Agent**

I understand this

he who commits suicide kills hlmself for his own benefit, he who commits martyrdom sacrifies
himlelf for the sake of his religion and his

nation… the mujahed is full of hope

how are we supposed to coordinate this brother?

**AusWitness**

lt's easy, brother. All you need is a gun. I have found a way to get one myself. My cousin has one
that he'II give me later this week.

Once I see on the news that you have carried out your attack, I will carry out mine.

**AFP Federal Agent**

This does not make sense, we should do it at the same time

didn't  you  say  that  we  would do  it  at  the  same  time?

i will not have the money this week brother as i told  you before  i need to sell my  car

**AusWitness**

At the exact same time? I thought I was gonna do it right after you did it.

But we can do it at the exact same time. I can use Twitter on my phone.

I just got a new phone from a relative.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have many questions. what day of the week? what time of the day?

brother what is wrong with your internet? is it because of these proxies you are using. i cannot sit here all night waiting for you to reply

why do you not use your phone to message me on twitter? it will be just as fast and twitter is also anonymous

**AusWitness**

Hold on. I am researching when the most Jews are at synagogue.

**AFP Federal Agent**

jews worship everyday, three times a day

**AusWitness**

We should target when the Jews are worshiping.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i thought you had thought this through and had a plan?

**AusWitness**

i do have it figured out. I just hadn't set an exact time.

**AFP Federal Agent**

what sort of gun are you getting from your cousin?

**AusWitness**

He told me it's a semi-automatic rifle.

I can target a synagogue in Perth at the same time.

I found something to target, when many Jews will be there: caoJlfieldsïule corn au/calendar event

I can target a synagogue in Perth at the same time.

**AFP Federal Agent**

this coming saturday?

                    

this  is not much time to make preparations brother

**AusWitness**

I can find a later event if you need me to, but this seemed like a perfect event to strike. Tons of
Jews will be there.

**AFP Federal Agent**

I will pray about it tonight. are you on twiltter on your phone during the day? so that I can discuss
with you i need to

**AusWitness**

When would you like to discuss it? I can get on whenever you need me to.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i also use an encrypted chat app on my phone to talk to other mujahid in syria, it is called sure spot. have you used this?

**AusWitness**

lt's not available on my phone. Sorry, brother

**AFP Federal Agent**

what phone do you have?

**AusWitness**

lt's an old Nokia.

**AFP Federal Agent**

what about your new phone? it is very safe.

**AusWitness**

The old Nokia is the one my relative gave me. I think it's from a few years ago.

**AFP Federal Agent**

ok, i will message you again on twitter tomorrow morning brother. there are many thoughts swirling
around in my head tonight.

i will try to get some rest now. goodnight, thank you for talking with me.

**AusWitness**

No problem, brother. I hope we can coordinate this for Saturday. Good luck, and may Allah (SWT)
bless you. Goodnight.

NEXT DAY

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother, i am sorry i have not been in contact with you for a while. i have been out looking
al some of the locations you provided me

i am unsure whether they would be the right places to undertake jihad. some of them have very good
security, it would be suicide

i have been doing a lot of reading about martyrdom and I want to ensure lhat i ascend to paradise

and not burn in the hell fire for committing an act of suicide. what are your thoughts on this brother?

i am readig that there is a difference between fighting to the death....... and conducting a
suicide mission in   Allah's   name (PBUH)

suicide is considered the most reprehensible deed for which the eward is it to burn in the
hellfire, this I am afraid of

**AusWitness**

Brother, it is not suicide if you are martyred in battle with the enemies of Allah (SWT). The Jews
are the enemies of Allah (S\IVT).

What we need is to target synagogues that have minimal security.

Remember that the Jews killed the Rasul (SAW) & he died a shaheed.

lf we truly love the Prophet {PBUH), we must engage in jihad against Jews to avenge the Rasul's
(SAW) death.

Did this event have too much security? caulf:elcfshule com au/calendar-evenl

This place has Shabbat morning services starting at 9:30 AM Saturday: e. h1latn·1za11or·g a
1/wo·srnp hh1I It would be a good target. Many Jews there.

Also, 1 don't think they have very much security.

**AFP Federal Agent**

good evening brother, i am going out to a farm on the weekend to test fire the rifle. i do not have
the money to buy it at this time

i would like to be familiar wilth using it though

how are you going in obtaining a gun?

**AusWitness**

I got the gun, brother. Do you know when you will be able to purchase your gun?

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother, i am still trying to get the money together. i have a fmily member who may be willing to buy my car

do you have a photo of the gun? do you know how to use it?

good morning brother, what are your plans for today?

i will send you a video of me shooting the rifle

are you able to send me a black shahada flag? i don't know where I would find one.  

i am not going to ask around for fear that it would draw attention to me

**AusWitness**

Here is my gun: .i imgur.comfP:520CcAh jpg I know how to use it. Black shahada flags can be bought
online, or you could make one.

Are you prepared for jihad, brother? I have everything I need.

**AFP Federal Agent**

good evening brother, i still have some things to sort out, but everything is coming together

i went to a farm today and shot the SKS lifte. il was working but had a couple of misfires, i am
told it is the ammunition,

is it old or something?? the seller told me that he would service the rifle and get out some new bullets.

i have some video footage which i will send to you later. do not show anyone this video please.

there are a lot of people around my house tonight. i will contact you tomorrow. sleep well brother.

**AusWitness**

My gun is an AR-180. Get the seller to service the rifle and get new bullets, then buy it. 

Don't worry, I wiII not show anyone the video footage. Will you have the SKS by Friday?

NEXT DAY

**AFP Federal Agent**

good morning brother, i hope you have been well

i had a look at the AR-180 on google too. that looks like a serious gun. have you also had a chance to test fire this??

the seller tells me he is working on the misfire problem. i should be heading back out there today to have another test 
fire with new

ammunition

he still has not sent me the video but i'II take one on my phone today and send as soon as i can

**AusWitness**

Yes, I test fired my gun. It works perfectly. Did you have another test fire with yours?

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother, couldn’t get out to the property yesterday. i had two people come around to look at my car.

i will not be ready by Friday. i am desperately trying to sell my car to get enough money to buy
the gun.

Unless you have other suggestions to get the money more quickly brother? l am going to need more
time to coordinate this

we need to have a conversation about the details for planning this jihad to maximise the effect. i still
have not chosen a suitable location

we also need to discuss how we are going to coordinate this at the same time. i feel that you might be rushing this without more thought

planning for this consumes my every waking minute but i feel like i am doing this without any guidance

may Allah (SWT) reward me for my intentions.

**AusWitness**

I understand. brother. Did you look at the last link I sent you, which has the Shabbat services?
Thal seems like a good target.

When the day cornes, we will meet on here at 9:00 AM, and we will give each other the go-ahead.

As far as making money goes, is there anything else you could sell?

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have some good news brother, a family member has given me a desposit for my car

yes i did have a look at the Shabbat services link. i am going go and have a look on Saturday

i finally have that video of us test firing  the gun. lt is still not functioning properly as soon as possible bit.ly/1cXS0gA

**AusWitness**

Thank you, brother. We need to do this soon, before any kuffar discover our plans.

Do you have the money to buy the gun now?

Are you there, brother? Did you have a look at the synagogue I showed you?

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes i am, sorry brother. i hope you are well. there have been a lot of people around my house. have been trying to keep to myself.

i agree, it needs to happen soon. it has just been hard for me to get the money so quick.

i am happy that i got the $200 deposit from my family member. she said that she will hopefully have the entire amount by next weekend =)

then i can buy the gun

i did look at the synagogue. that looks like a  good place brother. very busy.

**AusWitness**

I am  so glad to hear, brother. So, we will be launching our attacks on Saturday the 27th at 9:30
AM. correct?

I have found the perfect place to target in Perth, where many Jews will be.

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes my brother. Things are looking good. I hope that Allah (SWT) will bless me and that i will get
the money by next weekend to buy the gun.

inshallah

you  have  not  said  anything  about  the  video brother?

great news about the Perth target. where are you thinking?

**AusWitness**

I saw the video, brother. lt's a very impressive gun. l'm very glad you were able to obtain it.

I will be targeting this place when the day comes: dianellashule.com

Will you have the gun by Saturday the 27th?

Are you there, brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes, brother i am here sorry, as i have said, i can only get on to this twitter account at certain times as i dont want any family members

to question what im doing.

it is a very powerful gun and will cut the filthy kuffar in half!

thank you for the link brother. i had a look at the dianella shule and that looks like a good target.

im just worried that I wont be able to get the gun by saturday. my family member is coming to my house on sunday to actualli give me the

money and take the car. then i can get back in contact with the seller and buy the gun. does that sound ok??

**AusWitness**

Yes, brother, that sounds okay. What day do you think you'll be able to get the gun?

We need to do this as quickly as possible. I don't want ASIO finding us before we can pull this off.

**AFP Federal Agent**

good morning brother. well im hoping that i will get all of the money this weekend, maybe sunday but
i will let you know exacty. inshallah

i agree brother. it needs to be done soon. but its hard for a young brother with not much money.
are you still planning for this saturday ??

i have been doing alot of thinking about the security of twitter. i dont want to get caught by also either.

i saw this link too

i think i will only use surespot from now on brother..

**AusWitness**

Brother, I do not have a phone that can use Surespot. The kuffar don't know about this Twitter
account. so it's safe for us to talk here.

Let's attack on Monday, after you get the gun. I want to do this quickly and we need to attack on
the same day.

On second thought, let's attack NEXT Saturday. Saturday, July 3rd, at 9:30 AM. when the Jews are
having Shabbat.

How does that sound, brother? You'II have the gun by July 3rd, right?

Did you get the gun, akhi?

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother, sorry about the long reply again, i was very busy on the weekend with family things.
i hope you have been well

i did sell my car yesterday. finally!! so 1 have around $1800 because i spent a little bit of the
deposit. very good news.

i havent been able to get the gun yet. the seller is taking a litlle while to get back to me. I sent
him another text earlier.

the mujahideen I am speaking to in syria are telling me to get off twitter brother. i think you
should reconsider surespot.

now that i have money, i can send you my old iphone???

**AusWitness**

Will you have the gun by Saturday, brother? That's when I want us to attack.

I use Tor when I go on Twitter, sa the kuffar can't get my real IP address. Do you use Tor,
brother?

**AFP Federal Agent**

are you there brother?

what if twitter shut down our accounts because of what we were talking about? how will we contact eachother??

**AusWitness**

Brother, Twitter cannot see our private messages. There is nothing to be worried about. Also, we
have each other's emails addresses.

Our direct messages to each other are private. Nobody can see our private messages. We just can't
tweet about this publicly.

**AFP Federal Agent**

i have been doing some 198ding about tor. maybe I should start using that. does that just hide the
ip address for your internet??

is that all you’re using brother?

im only worried because i keep hearing that twitter isnt the safest place to chat

i understand what you said though brother

also brother, i have been working  a video to upload to youtube when we do the attacks. i'II hopefully have
something to show you soon.

**AusWitness**

I think we are safe. ASIO has no idea we're going to attack soon, and neither does anyone else. We
attack this Saturday, right?

You will have the gun by Saturday, right, brother? Because I really lhink we need to attack this
Saturday, July 3rd.

**AFP Federal Agent**

ok brother, well in that case i might start using tor to hide my ip address, just incase, do you think so??

brother i want to commit to this saturday but i do not think im ready yet. i still havent got the gun and im not much use withut it.

the seller is taking ages to respond! i will call him today and get out there asap to buy it

another brother that i am speaking to on surespot suggested that i do the attack with someone else in melbourne. what do you think?

**AusWitness**

Yes, brother, all mujahideen should use Tor to stay anonymous.

I really want to attack this Saturday, brother. I have the whole thing planned out. Please try to
gel the gun ASAP.

Do you know anyone else in Melbourne who couId attack with you? I still want to attack in Perth on
the same day you attack in Melbourne.

**AFP Federal Agent**

yes brother I have been talking with other mujahedeen on sure spot and they have put me in contact
with brothers in melbourne

some of these brothers have been talking about the “Book of Terror". do you have access to this book? 

i cannot find it anywhere on the net.

**AusWitness**

I don't know what that is, brother. I have never even heard of it. l'm sorry.

Do you have the gun, brother?

I would really like to carry out the attacks this Saturday, when the Jews are having their Shabbat
services.

I got an iPad and downloaded Surespot, brother. My username is AusWitness. Is your username
mohamadmo7?

Brother, it is almost Saturday. Do you have the gun?

Brother, are you okay? I have not heard from you in days.

Okay, I am really getting worried about you. Are you still there? Please respond tome to let me now
you're okay.

**AFP Federal Agent**

hello brother.  yes i am ok. lm very sorry about the delay. i just havent been online to be honest. sorry that we could not do saturday.

i have been out at the farm during the weekend with the selelr. and good news, i now have the gun!!

good news about surespot! much better and safer place to talk i think.

did u want to chat on there instead?

and yes sorry brother, my username on surespot is the same

**AusWitness**

I am so glad to hear you got the gun, brother! I sent you some messages on Surespot. Please respond
ASAP.

Brother. have you been getting my messages on Surespot? I have not heard from you in days.

Brother, Il has been a WEEK since l've heard from you. Why are you not online or on Surespot? Have
you been captured by the kuffar?

Do you stuII check your Twitter, akhi?

**AFP Federal Agent**

Salam akhi. I check it but i am trying not to use it because its riddled with kuffar. Ma salamah.

**AusWitness**

I would like to chat with you on this secure, encrypted chatroom, brother: ..chatcrypt.com

Can we organise a time to chat?

Brother, where are you? You have not been on Surespot in a week. Is your Surespot working?

Brother, it has been three weeks since I have heard from you. Where are you?

Brother, it has again been a week since l've heard from you. I get very worried when I don't hear
from you, akhi. Please get on Surespot.

Brother, if your Surespot is not working, then we need to go back to talking to each other on here.

Akhi. please download kik and add me on there. l'm AusWitness.

hello brother. very sorry i had to commit to going away with my family for a few days. they had
organised going away for the weekend and I couldnt get out of it.

*13/07/2015, 11:55 AM*

i still have lo keep up family appearances

i apologise brother. i hope you have been well??

the melbourne brother hasn't got a gun but is very willing to get involved. the kuffar wouldnt know
how to find us on here. impossible to be captured =)

my melbourne brother will not speak to anyone else. i had already asked him to try and speak with
you too but he didn’t want to

I am sorry if I sounded upset, brother. I was just very worried that you had been captured by the

No problem brother that was my mistake. i will let you know, next lime that I wont be online for a

how is your planning going? anything new?
*13/07/2015, 3:45 pm*

my melboume brother is pretty much only speaking with me, we went to school together, so he trusts
me.
*13/07/2015, 3:46 pm*

he will be good. very motivated. he is trying to get a weapon so im trying to direct him to my
seller too.

*13/07/2015, 3:46 pm*

he doesnt know why we want to larget Jews though??

*13/07/2015, 3:46 pm*

brother the only reason i havent done it on my own is because I want to plan for something much
bigger. especially with my other brother 

i want to do a video, with a shahada flag, maybe even wait for a big event to attack

*13/07/2015, 3:47 pm*

and we can do all of this together?? i just dont want to rush it for no reason

*13/07/2015, 3:49 pm*

ill be back on later, talk soon brother. inshallah

*13/07/2015, 3:49 pm*

**AustraliWitness**
Brother, l've got it all planned out. Right before we attack, im going to mail letters filled with
deadly ricin to several Australian politicians.

*13/07/2015, 4:07 pm*

The Jews killed the Rasul {SAW) and he died a shaheed. So, if we truly love the Prophet (PBUH), then
we need to attack the Jews to avenge the Rasul’s (SAW) death.

*13/07/2015, 4:08 pm*

If we both attack together this Saturday, it wiII be the biggest attack in Australian history. We
don't need to wait several more months. We need to attack this Saturday, while the Jews are
having shabbat. Trust me, brother. Large eventss have lots of security, but the synagogues have no
security right now. so we can easily kill tons of kuffar.

*13/07/2015, 4:10 pm*

ls your gun dealer on Surespot or Twitter, brother? I know some mujahideen who want to buy guns,
but I don't know any dealers. I got my gun from a relative.

*13/07/2015, 4:13 pm*

Brother, I understand what you want to do. You want us to pull of a 9/11 calibre, attack and kill
thousands of kuffar. But that’s just not possible right now. Please consider it, brother. We cannot wait any longer.  If we both shoot up synagogues and l send ricin to politicians, it will still be the biggest attack Australia has ever seen. Please consider it, brother. We cannot wait any longer. If we keep delaying this, the kuffar wiII find us and stop us before we can attack.

*13/07/2015, 7:55 pm*

This Saturday is the PERFECT day to attack, akhi. Pulling off this allack right after Ramadan ends
would send a much stronger message to the kuffar, and would ensure us a place in Jannah.

Brother, I have important news. I have made a deal with a mujahid in Sydney. The mujahid is
willing to attack with us this SaIurday. But, if we don’t attack this Saturday, he plans to make hijrah to Syria. You HAVE to commit to this Satwday, brother. You attack in Melbourne, this brother  attacks in Sydney, I mail ricin to politicians, then I attack in Perth.

lm not wanting to wait several months brother. you are reading me wrong. I need to make sure that I do
this right so i ascend to paradise.

*14/07/2015, 9:29 pm*

i want to make a video and have a long standing message to the kuffar and the world. i was even
thinking of doing a seige at the event.

*14/07/2015, 9:30 pm*

you cannot worry about the kuffar finding out. i dont see how they could even know? i have taken a lot
of security tips from you and even have a pre paid sim for internet

*14/07/2015, 9:32 pm*

that is good news about the sydney mujahid brother! i will let my melbourne brother know. maybe he
will be interested for us to get ready quicker. did you find him on surespot? Is he targeting a synagogue too?

**AustraliWitness**
I apologise, brother. It’s just that we really need to keep in regular contact with each other. I am sorry if I sounded impatient.

*14/07/2015, 10:09 pm*

Democracy is the system of shirk and kuffar, and these politicians fund wars against our Muslim
brothers around the world. They are the agents of Shaytan.

*14/07/2015,  10:10 pm*

What event are you refering to, brother? Big events always have lots of security. A mujahid did a siege in Sydney last year, but hardly any kuffar were killed. If we shoot up synagogues, we could kill tons of kuffar.

*14/07/2015, 10:12 pm*

I got the ricin through a fellow mujahid. He also introduced me to the Sydney mujahid. The Sydney mujahid isn’t on Surespot at the moment, but he has promised that, if we attack this Saturday, he will attack right after us on the same day. He also said he has a video prepared, so you don’t need to worry about making one.

*14/07/2015, 10:13 pm*

We must attack this Saturday, though. If we don’t, the Sydney mujahid said he would make hijrah to Syria instead.

*14/07/2015, 10:15 pm*

Here’s how it will happen: get your phone and drive to the synagogue. Make sure it’s busy. Then, get on Surespot and tell me you’re about to attack. The, get your gun out of your car, go in, and kill as many kuffar as possible. I will then mail the ricin and attack a synagogue in Perth. Then, the Sydney mujahid will upload the video and attack a synagogue in Sydney. I have it all planned out, brother. But it must happen this Saturday. Goodnight, akhi. Please get on tomorrow. We only have a few days left, and we must stay in contact with each other.

**AustraliWitness**
Large events always have at least some security, brother. At any large event, there will be cops
But, at the synagogues, there are no cops and no guards. There is nobody to stop us from killing tons of kuffar easily.

*16/07/2015, 2:55 pm*

Every time a mujahid tries to larget a large evem, he gets caught beforehand. Remember those
mujahid who planned to target Anzac Day, but gor caught before they could? The most successful
attacks always happen on random days 9/11, 7/7, and Charlie Hebdo didn’t target any specific events.
 They were so successful because they happened randomlly and the kuffar were totally
unprepared for them.

*16/07/2015, 2:57 pm*

The Sydney brother hasn't shown me his video because we only speak at the phone and he says he
can't risk the video getting out before it’s time. However, l trust him because he is a
very skilled mujahid and he has lots of experoe,ce.

*16/07/2015, 3:00 pm*

Didn’t you say your Melbourne brother didn’t have a gun, akhi? How is he going to attack with us, if he
doesn't have a gun? It could take him months to get a gun.

*16/07/2015, 3:01 pm*

We have spent more than a month preparing this, brother. This Saturday is the day we finally strike.

*16/07/2015, 3:02 pm*

By the way, I also have a mujahid on Los Angeles who promises to attack a synagogue there  if we att

*16/07/2015, 3:16 pm*

attack in Australia. He already has a gun and everything, but he told me he'II only attack if we
attack first.

*16/07/2015, 3:17 pm*

I really need you to commit to this Saturday, akhi. If we dont attack this Saturday, the Sydney
mujahid will not be able to attack with us. This is a perfect oppotunity we have, and we can’t waste
it. Please consider, akhi. We can pull off the biggest attack in Australian history together, if we do
it this Saturday.

*16/07/2015, 3:19 pm*

We aren't going to have an opportunity like this again, akhi. The Sydney mujahid is a trained expert in firearms, and he will kill dozens of kuffar. But it will only happen if we attack this Saturday. We cannot wait any longer. If we do not attack this Saturday, the Sydney mujahid will leave for Syria.

Brother, it is almost Saturday. We attack around 9:30 AM on Saturday. Please tell me you are ready. The Sydney mujahid is counting on us. All you have to is load up your gun, take it to the synagogue, then go in and shoot as manu kuffar as possible. I will do everything else. Remember, Brother : I have been coordinating this for over a month. I have everything planned out for Saturday, and so does the Sydney mujahid.

*17/07/2015, 12:55 pm*

There’s another reason why Saturday is the perfect day to attack, brother : all of the police will be too busy guarding those anti-Islam rallies. They won’t be able to stop us from killing Jewish kuffar in the synagogues. We only have a few hours left, akhi. Please don’t back out of this. We won’t have this kind of opportunity again.

He is going to be so angry at me if you back down from this, akhi. We can pull off an attack that will leave the kuffar on their knees, but you need to be willing to help me. I cannot do this on my own. We all need to work together to make this happen. Please, brother, I am begging you - PLEASE do not disappoint me.

💡 **20/07/2015 :** Post AustraliWitness sur 8chan Islamic State

</aside>

Greetings, /islamicstate/.  This is Australi Witness.

In a few weeks or perhaps even days, a mujahid that I met online will carry out jihad in Melbourne.  Here's a video of him test-firing his SKS rifle, made shortly before he bought the gun: [http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=v45eg9&s=8](https://archive.is/o/Qo3uq/tinypic.com/player.php?v=v45eg9&s=8)

To the left is a screenshot of my Surespot conversation with this mujahid.

Using his SKS rifle, he will enter a synagogue and open fire on the Jewish kuffar, slaughtering them in the name of Allah (SWT).  He bought his SKS rifle from a black market weapons dealer, selling his car so that he would have enough money to buy it.

I gave him the idea to attack a synagogue in Australia.  Before I spoke with him, he had no plans to attack.  I gave him the idea, I directed him to the synagogue, and I helped him coordinate the attack.  I am immensely proud of the fact that I was able to convince him to carry this out.

Here is a JustPaste document where I explain everything about myself in more detail: [https://justpaste.it/auswitness](https://archive.is/o/Qo3uq/https://justpaste.it/auswitness)

Contact me on Surespot if you'd like my help carrying out jihad in Australia or somewhere else.  My name on Surespot is AusWitness.  You can also email me at auswitness@yahoo.com.  I plan to help mujahideen coordinate more attacks in Australia and elsewhere.  I know lots of weapons dealers in Australia who can hook you up with any kind of gun or bomb you want.

I am an expert in computer security, and I am also an expert in Australian law thanks to my extensive work with Amnesty International Australia and other human rights organisations.  I am widely held up as a pillar of my community, and I am friends with some of the most prominent and respected Muslims in Australia.  The Australian kuffar have absolutely no chance of tracking me down.

Melbourne is not the only place that will soon be attacked.  I also have a mujahid in Los Angeles who will carry out a similar attack on a synagogue there.  I gave him the idea too.  This attack will be carried out later this year.

Remember, brothers: this attack in Melbourne is just a precursor to what is coming.  The Australian kuffar WILL pay for attacking the basic human rights of Muslims.  As I write this, a 9/11-caliber attack in Australia is on its way.

Islam will conquer Australia.  When Islam conquers Australia, every single Jew, homosexual, feminist, and non-Muslim will be exterminated. The same applies to Britain, America, France, Germany, Sweden, and all other kuffar nations.  All will be conquered by Islam, whether the kuffar like it or not.

Finally, I would like to state that you have not only the right, but the DUTY to carry out similar acts of jihad in the West.  Get any kind of weapon you can.  Get guns, knives, bombs, whatever, and go out and slaughter as many kuffar as possible.  Target Jews in particular, as the Jews killed the Rasul (SAW) and he died a shaheed.  So, if you truly love the Prophet (PBUH), then you must kill Jews to avenge the Rasul's (SAW) death.  If you aren't waging jihad against the kuffar, then you are not a true Muslim.  You have no excuse, brothers.  If you need help with carrying out jihad, then contact me on Surespot at AusWitness.

Until next time, brothers.

Thank you, brother. For the past several months, I have been
coordinating an act of jihad with a mujahid who lives in Melbourne.
He sold bis car to buy a gun, but be basn't carried out the attack yet because he wants to make a video message to the kuffar with a black shahada flag, and he also wants his friend to participate in the attack with him. However, I haven't heard anything from him since July 24th. I have tried messaging him on Surespot, DMing him on Twitter, and emailing him, but he won't respond.

This is the life though Ahki
*8/17/15 10:13 PM*
A few weeks ago I remember a lot of brothers in the U.S. Got arrested like
a bunch of them. They were all still proud.
*8/17/15 10:19 PM*
I was arrested a few days after. Released after a weekend. Was talking to a brother in the dawlah
when it happened. Kuff legal system bro. l’m sure Ahki is fine.

**AusWitness**
Australia has strict gun laws, but mohamadmo7 was able to buy a gun from a black market
weapons dealer. He bought an SKS rifle, which I' m pretty sure is illegal here. If the kuffar
found him, he could get a long prison sentence for owning an illegal gun and planning jihad .

ok akhi, i am sorry I wasnt responding before. I had another brother on twitter randomly message me
and show me a link to 8chan? where you had openly shown screen captures of what I have been saying
and openly telling peope  who i was. Links to my name my twitter, everything

*19/08/2015, 5:00 pm*

i was yery upset and stopped talking to you. my melbourne brother and i have kept quiet as i have
been afraid of the kuffar trying to find where i was because of that.
*19/08/2015, ?*

why didyou do that?? i was trying to be security aware and then you started telling people what we were doing??
*19/08/2015, 6:31 pm*

i have to go but i might be back on later, depending on what you say about this. i have kept quiet
and have been worried since nothing has happened, i feel i can start chatting on surespot again

**AustraliWitness**
Brother, i am so sorry I made that post when I thought the attack was going to happen in a few
hours. When the attack didn't happen, i tried to delete the thread, but I couldn't. I didn’t link to
your Twitter, I only included a screenshot of our conversations. At the time, I wanted to inspire
other mujahideen. This was during a time when l thought that our attack was imminent and I wanted to
leave a message behind that other mujahideen would see. It was very stupid of me. I should have asked
you first akhi. Again, when I posted that,I thought we were about to attack.

*19/08/2015, 6:42 pm*

I understand if you're mad at me, brother. I only posted that because I wanted to leave a message
behind because I thought our attack was imminent. I will never post anything like that
again
*19/08/2015, 6:45 pm*

I have spent the last several weeks absolutely terrified for you, akhi. I even made a Facebook account
so I could ask other Melbourne brothers if they had heard anything from you. I was
so scared that something had happened to you. You've been the only thing I could think about for
weeks. I was so worried that you had been captured by the kuftar.
*19/08/2015, 6:51 pm*

Please forgive me, akhi. I only made that post because I thought we were going to attack in a few
hours. When you disappeared, I was worried sick. I couldn't get any sleep because I was so worried about you, brother.

*19/08/2015, 6:56 pm*

Brother if it makes you feel any better, the site I posted the thread on is a Tor website. That means
kuffar can't trace anything on it. I also provided some false info in order to confuse any kuffar
who might see the thread.
*19/08/2015, 7:32 pm*

Akhi, I have been talking to an expert mujahid and he says there's no way the kuffar could find
you trom what I posted, especially since it's a Tor site. Would you like to talk to him?

Well, before he disappeared last time, he was insisting that,
before carrying out the attack, he wanted a make a video
message to the kuffar with a black shahada flag, and he
also wanted to bring his friend along to carry out the attack
with him. He said he wouldn't be a good Muslim if he didn't
give his friend the opportunity to become a martyr with him.
*8/20/15 12:40 AM*
He clearly wants to attack, since he sold his car to buy a

actually do it.

please just in the future akhi, at least tell me where you are making a post like that, i know you
have helped me out in the past few months and I am grateful, but i am just trying to take your lead
on internet security. if you get what i mean?

lt's easy, brother. Just dedicate your life to Allah (SWT) and he will show yov the path. It’s hard
having parents who are cuconuts, but just don't mention Jihad around them and you should be fine.
Be kind to your parents, and show them love, and they will eventually see the light.

Brother, if they are threatening to kick you out then we must carry out this attack ASAP Remember,
akhi, when you enter Jannah, you won’t need any money. The answer to all of our
problems is to carry out jihad and enter Jannah, leaving all of our earthly problems behind
*20/08/2015, 4:47 pm*

Same here, akhi. I was introduced to Anwar al-Awlaki

mujahid ever since. And, when I first heard about the lslamic

help them as much as I could .

Akhi, I've been talking to wilayahks and he says you seem reluctant. Are you really committed to
carrying this out with me, brother? Because it seems like you keep delaying it over and over again.
We can't keep waiting, akhi. If we don't carry this out soon, the kuffar will find us. This jihad is the
answer to all of our problems, brother. When we carry out this attack, we will be martyrs around
the world, and the lslamic State mujahideen will speak of us as heroes. And, once we enter Jannah,
all of our problems will cease to exist. We have nothing to lose, brother. Please - I am begging you,
akhi - please commit to carrying this out with me either this Saturday or next Saturday.

Also, brother, you HAVE to carry ouy this attack with me before wilayahks carries out his attack on
9/11. Once wilayahks carries out his attack, the kuffar are going to start seriously trying to track
me down since I gave him instructions. You’ve had the gun for months, brother. No more excuses. We
carry out the attack either this Saturday or next Saturday.
*27/08/2015, 4:03 pm*

All you have to do is get on Surespot at 9:30 AM on Saturday, tell me you’re ready, and then drive to
the synagogue with your gun and your friend, and go inside and kill as many kuffar as possible.
Then, I’ll drive down to the Perth synagogue and do the same thing. lt's very simple, brother. You're
making this too complicated.

Saturday, September 5 at 9·30 AM is when we strike, brother. Be ready by then. ll's all been leading
up to this. This is Allah's (SWT) destiny for us, brother. We will be heroes to mujahideen around the
world, and Allah (SWT] will reward us with seals right next to the Prophet (PBUH) in Jannah.

when I log in, my messages wont appear but then other times i login my full messages
are there?? so now it i displaying your messages? i use android. have you had the problem akhi?

maybe i should be using another app or something?? its really frustrating me akhi

im happy to keep using surespot though ,its your call

my melbourne brother has been quite difficult with me lately, he keeps saying that we shouldnt be
attacking a synagogue and be more smart about choosing a location so i have been telling him what ur
thoughts are
*31/08/2015, 1:39 pm*

i know it has been a while brother, but as I keep sayjng, i know you have helped me a lot with
information and targets etc but also want to make my own mark, allah swt willing. I feel the gun
and me alone won’t be enough
*31/08/2015, 1:40 pm*

im still trying to put together a flag etc bu im also relying on my other brother to get involved

do u only speak to wilahyaks on here brolher??

Akhi, if your Surespot is not working properly, then we need to go back to talking on Twitter.

*31/08/2015, 2:00 pm*

Trust me, brother : you alone with a gun would be more than enough. Just look at what happened in
Chattanooga. That was one mujahid with a gun, and he was sjooting at soldiers. Just
imagine how many unarmed Jewish kuffar you could kill.
*31/08/2015, 2:02 pm*

The attack HAS to happen by Saturday, brother. Because wilayahks is going to attack Kansas City on
9/11. Once wilayahks attacks, the kuffar are gonna try harder than ever to track me
down.

*31/08/2015, 2:05 pm*

A synagogue is the perfect place to attack, brother. The Jews are the agents of Shaytan, and they
control all Western governments. An attack on Jews would devastate all kurfar
governments.
*31/08/2015, 2:05 pm*

Think about it, akhi : you attack a synagogue in Melbourne, then I maiI the ricin to politicians, then I attack a synagogue in Perth. It will be the biggest attack in Australian history.
*31/08/2015, 2:07 pm*

Please commit to this attack on Saturday, September 5, brother. We won’t get a better opportunity
than this.

*31/08/2015, 2:15 pm*

Please, brother - I am begging you - commit to this Saturday. Together, we will carry out the biggest
act of Jihad ever seen in Australia. Then, a few days later, wilayahks will carry out his attack
on Kansas City. We have nothing to lose, akhi. This is Allah's (SWT) destiny for us.

My Surespot is not working at the moment, so l'm going to have to send you this message here.
Brother, do you have any idea how much hard work l've done preparing this attack? Do you have any
idea how long l've waited for you, how patient l've been, and how long l've been ready? I have been
ready for months, and l've done everything I can to help you get ready too. No other mujahid would
have been as patient as I have been. Every time I speak to a mujahid about you, they tell me that I
should just stop trying, and they tell me that you're never going to attack with me. But I refuse to give
up, because I trust you, brother. You promised me months ago that you would participate in this
attack with me, and a true Muslim doesn't tell false promises. You say that you're waiting for the right
time, but, brother, this IS the right time. You're not going to get a better time than this. Allah (SWT)
given you the perfect opportunity, yet you refuse to take it. Brother, how many more times are you
going to delay this? At this point, l'm starting to feel betrayed by you. I feel like you're never going to
attack with me, even though you promised me you would. And now I hear that you're planning to
donate money to brothers in the Islamic State? Akhi, are you TRYING to get caught? Sending money
from Australia to brothers in the dawlah GUARANTEES that the kuffar will capture you. If you want to
inspire brothers in the lslamic State, then you need to carry out this attack with me. THAT is how you
help the lslamic State, akhi. But, instead, you just keep making excuses for why you refuse to carry
out Allah's will. l'm getting tired of your excuses, brother. l'm starting to agree with what the other
mujahideen have told me: I don't think you're ever going to carry out this attack with me. l'm just so
disappointed, brother. I really thought you were a true shaheed.

salaam akhi, maybe it’s a surespot bug going around lol.
akhi, trust me i know how much you're committed to this and i know you have put a lot into speaking to
me about it, i am still going to attack, however my melbourne brother has been in my ear about
certain things, and he has suggested making a bigger mark, other than guns ... maybe even
something that will cause more destruction, i dont know.
i know you have been ready for months akhi, the thing is, why arent you going to do this by yourself if
committing jihad asap is key for you??
i never said i wasnt going to do it. all i said akhi, was that i have progressed a little in my planning and
coordination with my melbourne brother, keeping it local and maximising the attack here in
melbourne.
Other mujahids will say what they want to benifet themselves, we are all united here but please akhi,
just know that im not dismissing everything you have done, i am just taking time to make sure i am
doing jihad my way, i hate the kuffar and they need to pay. especially for brainwashing my parents, to
which they have shown no remorse for.
i appreciate that you trust me akhi, i trust you too, i just think we are on slightly different pages at the
moment. i need to commit jihad in my own time brother,
what can i do to prove my faith and trust to you? to restore your trust?? tell me akhi?? can i send you
some money instead? instead of over to IS?
im not delaying and telling you false promises, as i said akhi, in my own time, allah swt has a will for
me and me only. i will die a shaheed!!!

*03/09/2015 13;09* 
**Australi Witness**
Akhi, your Melbourne brother is going to get you caught. He has no idea what he's talking about. The
longer you delay this attack and the more people you get involved, the more likely you are to get
caught. Lone wolf attacks with guns are the most effective kind of attack for striking terror into the
hearts of the kuffar. You need to forget about this idea of pulling off some "bigger" attack. Brother, we
cannot pull off a 9/11-caliber attack in Australia. We do not have the time or resources for that. What
we CAN do is carry out the biggest attack in Australian history if we both attack on the same day. The
attack is already going to be huge if you just agree to carry it out. Trying to make it even "bigger" will
only get us caught. Akhi, I really think you need to forget about bringing your Melbourne brother along
for this. He can become a shaheed some other way, akhi. But, right now, he's only going to delay this
attack even further.
On September 13 is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. lf you're not willing to attack by then, then I
don't think you're ever going to attack. Yom Kippur is the absolute best possible time to attack the
kuffar. The synagogue will be more crowded than ever. Remember, brother: the Jews are the ones
who brainwashed your parents. The Jews are the ones who control the kuffar government and the
kuffar media. The Jews are the ones who slaughter innocent Muslims around the world. The Jews
killed the Rasul (SAW). So, if we truly love the Prophet (PBUH), then we are obligated to carry out
jihad against Jews.

You say you want to commit the attack on "your own time", but when is "your own time", brother?
When? When are you ever going to be ready? lt doesn't seem like you ever are. Allah's will for you is
to carry out this attack, and you are making excuses for why you refuse to carry out Allah's will. Allah's
will does not accept excuses, brother.
On September 11, wilayahks will carry out his attack in Kansas City. Once wilayahks carries out his
attack, the kuffar are going to try harder than ever to track me down - and they might actually manage
to capture me. And, if the kuffar capture me, they will also capture my friends. If we don't enter
Jannah within the next few days, we will get caught, akhi. Do you want us to get captured by the
kuffar and tortured for information, brother? Or do you want to enter Jannah? The choice is yours.
Please, akhi - please carry out this attack with me. You have had months and months to get ready. I
have been as patient as I can possibly be. No more excuses, brother. lt's time for us to become
shaheeds and carry out Allah's will together. If you do this with me, your name will become legendary,
and the kuffar will feel terror in their hearts just from the mere mention of your name. You will become
a heroic martyr for mujahideen around the world. But, if you keep delaying this, you wi ll be just
another mujahid who got caught before he could attack. Make your decision soon, brother. There isn't
much time left.

*03/09/2015 13:10*
**Australi Witness**
Sorry, I meant September 22. Yom Kippur is on September 22. But the kuffar might capture me
before then.

*03,09/2015 13:42*

Also, you should know that Surespot is no longer safe, and the kuffar can track us through it, so

Jzk for the response, akhi. Check your Facebook messages, as I responded again. September 13 is the
day wilayahks attacks, and it’s also the day that the Jewish kuffar are holding Erev Rosh Hashanah
services. The synagogues wiII be very crowded. lt's the perfect time to attack.

Maybe you’re right akhi, I don't know. He has been such a good brother to me in the past but I am
sick of waiting for him also. He's just wanting to do something separate from guns, something that will
cause much more destruction, but I don't know, inshallah we can work this out together, he is a good
Muslim.
i agree akhi, as u know, i have always wanted to stick to the gun idea, i mean, i have the gun and i
want to use it, i want to show the kuffar that they are not untouchable, and that Islam will soon rule the
world. Brothers over in IS would love this wouldn't they??
I'Il google yom kippur, plenty of jews akhi?? What type of celebration is it? Security guiards etc?? lm
starting to think that maybe we should act and that maybe this festival would be an idea. I’ll have a
good look akhi, I promise. Maybe I can even influence my brother. ..
Do you and wilayahks have a location picked out? Cant you include me a bit more in whats going on
there? If our attack would be related to what he is doing then I should know more akhi??
Kuffar cannot capture you brother, you have been too smart with ur internet security. Tor and what
not. How couId they even get through that?? Do not be paranoid brother, I had a right to be paranoid
when you leaked my twitter on 8chan but I am still here, do not worry. Allah swt is protecting us.
Jzk for your worry akhi, I know you have been there with me for months, let me try and sort out with
my Melbourne brolher and i’ll keep u updated. If he's going to take forever, then im more inclined to
follow you.
At the end of the day, kuffar will pay, our plans will spark fear into ail of their hearts. No one can be
safe here. I feel that allah swt has guided me properly. Ma salamah akhi, may allah swt bless you and
reward you for your intentions. Alhamdulillah .

*04/09/2015 17:05*
**Australi Witness**
Jzk for your response, akhi. Your Melbourne brother might be a good brother, but it sounds tome like
he doesn't really want to attack. If we pull off this attack together, it will already be the largest attack in
Australian history. We can't obsess over carrying out something "bigger'', because we don't have the
resources to do that. We can't carry out something like 9/11, akhi. That's not possible for us. But, with
our guns and my ricin, we can still carry out a massive attack that will strike fear into the hearts of
kuffar around the world, Allah (SWT) willing. ·
Take a look at the synagogue schedule, akhi: httpJ/www kehHatnitzan org aufworship html
There are lots of big events coming up that we could target.
Wilayahks and I have picked out our location. Turns out it's actually going to be on September 13.
Akhi, do you think you couId agree to carry out the attack on September 13? lt would be perfect. We
carry out our attack in Australia, then wilayahks carries out his attack in Kansas City.
Looking at the schedule, it would appear that there is a targe Erev Rosh Hashanah service on
September 13. We should target that, akhi. This is the absolute perfect time to target. We can't keep
waiting, brother. We need to carry out Allah'swill.
September 13 at 6 PM at Kehilat Nitzan, akhi. Can you commit to this? I already have a local
synagogue to target in Perth too.
We attack Australia, then wilayahks attacks Kansas City. We will be legendary martyrs.

Salaam akhi, shukran for the messages and for seeking help from jihadUK, may Allah swt reward

Yah akhi, i understand that we cant do a 911 style attack but i always beleived it could be bigger.
Especially with my melbourne brother by my side to slay as many filthy kuffar as possible. lm still
trying to get him on board, but inshallah he will see Allah swt will soon.
I will have a look at that synagogue. Is it september 13 or 22? I think you originally corrected yourself
and said 22? I’ll confirm online anway.
Thats good he has a location in kansas city akhi. Is he set and ready to go? Wasnt he making a
bomb??
What synagogue in Perth are you looking at akhi? Have you made sure no security etc? September
13 sounds like a plan akhi. Especially when it is coordinated with a usa mujahid brother.
Jihaduk did message me and i accepted him on surespot. Ill talk to him tonight. We should start
talking back on there. Mine seems to be working ok now. Ma salamah akhi, talk later.

lt's on September 13, akhi. This is different from what I was telling you about before. This is Erev
Rosh Hashanah, which cornes before Yom Kippur. lt will be very crowded, and there will be tons of
Jewish kuffar to kill. The services at the Melbourne synagogue I showed you start on September 13 at
6 PM. Remember that, akhi. The address is 36-40 Hawthorn Road, Caulfield North. Here it is on a

I am so glad you've finally agreed to carry this out with me, brother. We are going to become

Remember, brother: from now on, you have to get on Surespot every day. We don't have much time

I can driveto the Perth shule, brother. Are you sure you’ll be able to get to the Melbourne
synagogue I showed you on September 13 at 6 PM? Make sure you have a way to get there on
time, brother .

*8/09/2015, 3:29 pm*

Akhi, Jihadi says it's too late for him to mail you the flag. But that's not important, brother. We
don’t need any flags. Our actions will speak louder than any flag, inshaallah.

Create a wave of them
*9/10/15 6:08 AM*
The kuffar will live in constant fear
*9/10/15 6:10 AM*
I tried putting the pressure cooker in
the backpack and the nails make a
sound every time I step
*9/10/15 6:10 AM*
Do you think I will get caught
because of this?
*9/10/15 6:12 AM*
You there?

Yes, akhi, we will set off a
wave of attacks, especially
since mohamadmo will be
attacking on the same day. We
will be the spark that ignites a
revolution, and the kuffar will
live in criplling fear.

People probably won't notice.
Just put a lot of other stuff in
your backpack too.

Do you think people will notice the
backpack on the ground

I think people look for that after
Boston
*9/10/15 6:21 AM*
Maybe I will get instead of a plain
backpack a kids looking backpack se
people won't be suspicious of its on
the ground
*9/10/15 6:21 AM*
Like maybe a kid left it

What do you think
*9/10/15 6:23 AM*
Sorry if l'm
*9/10/15 6:24 AM*
Bothering you with all the questions
*9/10/15 6:24 AM*
I get the feeling you’re distracted
*9/10/15 6:24 AM*
I hope that's all it is
