"Right now, I'm trying to get a mujahid in Melbourne to carry out jihad, but he keeps delaying it. He has a gun already, but he insists on making a video message to the kuffar with a black shahada flag. He also insists on getting his friend to carry out jihad with him. I am afraid he'll get caught before he can do it.",AusWitness,,"July 28, 2015 10:04 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"Are you in Australia, brother?",AusWitness,,"July 30, 2015 9:54 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot

"Well bro he hasn 't gotten back to
me ...",wilayahks,,"August 5, 2015 8:38 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"If he was captured, it would be
my fault. I mentioned him in a
post on a discussion board for
mujahideen. I feel so guilty
about this. I am so worried
about him.",AusWitness,,"August 5, 2015 1:10 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"If the kuffar captured him with
his gun, it would be on the
news, right?",AusWitness,,"August 5, 2015 1:11 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
I would assume?,wilayahks,,"August 6, 2015 7:40 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"I don't know what to tell you bro ",wilayahks,,"August 6, 2015 7:42 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"The thread I posted about him was on http://8ch.net/islamicstate.
Do you think the kuffar could capture him just from that thread?",AusWitness,,"August 6, 2015 11:08 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
No I mean it's an onion site,wilayahks,,"August 7, 2015 8:12 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
And surespot isn't traceable,wilayahks,,"August 7, 2015 8:12 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Sounds like he got cold feet to be honest,wilayahks,,"August 7, 2015 8:12 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"Well, I posted a link to a video he posted. Couldn't the kuffar trace his I P from that? Or from
his Twitter, which has the same username?",AusWitness,,"August 7, 2015 10:38 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"He often takes a long time to respond to me, but it's never taken THIS long. The last thing
he sent me was a promise that he would send me updates more often.",AusWitness,,"August 7, 2015 10:39 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
These are the last messages he sent me.,AusWitness,,"August 8, 2015 10:31 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Yeah ahki I dunno there's not much you can do at this point,wilayahks,,"August 9, 2015 12:23 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
The bottom line is if you feel safe being caught shouldn 't be an issue,wilayahks,,"August 9, 2015 12:23 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
You can always plan something else,wilayahks,,"August 9, 2015 12:23 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"What makes it worse is that he hasn't responded to my emails or my messages on Twitter either. But, if the kuffar had
captured him, then surely it would be on the news? I just don't understand.",AusWitness,,"August 10, 2015 1:16 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Yes it would have been on the news they love showing that kind of news,wilayahks,,"August 10, 2015 8:17 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
If they got him they'd have gotten you right?,wilayahks,,"August 10, 2015 8:23 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"Well, l 'm not sure. I mean, I used proxies to post. I don't
think he used a proxy to upload that video clip that I posted.",AusWitness,,"August 10, 2015 9:51 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"l've tried messaging him on Twitter and emailing him, but I get nothing.",AusWitness,,"August 10, 2015 9:51 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Cold feet bro,wilayahks,,"August 10, 2015 10:21 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot

stupid thread on Behan. What was I thinking?",AusWitness,,"August 13, 2015 2:22 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Don't beat yourself up ahki.,wilayahks,,"August 13, 2015 7:24 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
If he were arrested it would be in the news,wilayahks,,"August 13, 2015 7:25 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
If you're serious its time to focus on other things. Don't get tied down by it.,wilayahks,,"August 13, 2015 7:25 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Maybe he went here ahki ^^’,wilayahks,,"August 13, 2015 4:41 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Jokes aside may Allah swt bless them all,wilayahks,,"August 13, 2015 4:42 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"I just can't get over this, akhi.
The kuffar government could be torturing him for info right now, and ail because I made
the stupid mistake of talking about our plans on Behan. If I find out he got caught because
of me, I just don't know what I’ll do. I feel like I have failed as a Muslim.",AusWitness,,"August 14, 2015 7:07 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"Best to get that out of your head
ahki. He knew the risks when he started planning. We all do.",wilayahks,,"August 14, 2015 7:30 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Why Australia bro? Just curious. Are they as bad as the US?,wilayahks,gold,"August 15, 2015 7:41 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot

Australia is as bad as the US.",AusWitness,gold,"August 15, 2015 12:37 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
But you don't know he's been caught.,wilayahks,,"August 15, 2015 7:40 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot

"l'm still worried, akhi.",AusWitness,,"August 17, 2015 10:03 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot

mind.",wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:04 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot

start another year of college.",wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:06 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"Honestly bro I found you and was like this brother is the haqq a true

bad bro.",wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:07 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
This is the life though Ahki,wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:12 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"A few weeks ago I remember a lot of brothers in the U.S. Got arrested like
a bunch of them. They were all still proud.",wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:13 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"I was arrested a few days after. Released after a weekend. Was talking to a brother in the dawlah
when it happened. Kuff legal system bro. l’m sure Ahki is fine.",wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:19 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot

Temporarily inshallah,wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:28 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Like I said in and out the paperwork was fine I was never even charged,wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:30 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"How did you avoid getting
charged, brother? The Australian legal system is much stricter about guns.",AusWitness,,"August 17, 2015 10:36 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
They detained me for 72 hours because they're filthy kuff but that was it,wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:39 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"lt' s funny the Kuff law is exactly what will do them in. Lol it's sooo easy to
get a gun especially in the Midwest. No idea what Australia is like. I always thought they were gun friendly.",wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:44 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"Australia has strict gun laws, but mohamadmo7 was able to buy a gun from a black market
weapons dealer. He bought an SKS rifle, which I' m pretty sure is illegal here. If the kuffar
found him, he could get a long prison sentence for owning an illegal gun and planning jihad .",AusWitness,,"August 17, 2015 10:47 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
Bithnillah he is safe,wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:48 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot

kuffar and keep him safe.",AusWitness,,"August 17, 2015 10:57 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot

State mujahideen were supposedly gonna blow up the
Queen of England a few days ago?",AusWitness,,"August 17, 2015 10:58 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
I heard something of it but didn't read much of it,wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 10:59 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"I was actually really disappointed when it didn't happen. The UK needs a new 7 /7. They kill our brothers and
sisters all over the world.",AusWitness,,"August 17, 2015 11:07 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"The UK is one of many that deserve it. We were supposed to have a few
ops here on July 4 that didn't happen. lt was so disappointing.",wilayahks,,"August 17, 2015 11:08 PM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"If you want maybe I’ll be around.

"Akhi, mohamadmo7 just sent me a few messages. He said he was upset that I made that
thread, and he's been hiding because he was worried about being caught. What can I do to
make him feel better?",AusWitness,,"August 19, 2015 4:05 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
"I agree with you, akhi. But he says he was trying to be
secure and the thread put him at risk of being caught by the
kuffar. He's very upset about it. I just hope he doesn't stay mad.",AusWitness,,"August 19, 2015 6:27 AM",Quentin Sombsthay,Surespot
