# Liminal Space aesthetic

Liminal spaces are fascinating because they are neither here nor there, not quite one thing or another. They exist in a state of ambiguity, caught between different states of being. These spaces can be physical, such as abandoned buildings, empty houses, or parking lots, but they can also be psychological or emotional. For example, the time between wakefulness and sleep can be thought of as a liminal space, as can the period between one phase of life to the next, such as adolescence to adulthood.

Liminal spaces can evoke a range of emotions and feelings, from surrealism and nostalgia to uncertainty and unease. There is a sense of strangeness, of being somewhere that is not quite right, or not quite safe. It is as if the rules of the world no longer apply, and anything could happen.

Despite their unsettling nature, liminal spaces can also be appealing. They hold a certain allure, perhaps because they are so different from the familiar and the everyday. They are places where we can reflect on the past, dream about the future, or simply be in the moment.

A Liminal Space is defined as a "moving point" - a place in between, wether it be metaphorical (e.g. a period after exams but before graduation, where you still feel weird) or literal (bus stops, airports). Kenopsia has a much wider definition of, simply, empty places.

**Kenopsia** is a word coined by John Koenig in *The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows*. It refers to the eerie, forlorn atmosphere of a place that is usually bustling with people but is now abandoned and quiet. It is the feeling of emptiness and disconnection that comes with being in a place that is normally filled with life and activity, but is now silent and still.
