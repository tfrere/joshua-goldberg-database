> At approximately 6:50 p.m. Central Standard Time, [I] was driving eastbound on Naaman Forest Boulevard, coming from the vicinity of the intersection of North Garland Avenue and Naaman Forest Boulevard. As [I] approached the western edge of the parking lot for the Curtis Culwell Convention Center, [I] was driving behind a dark colored sedan. When that vehicle drove to the western access point to the southern parking lot of the Convention Center, [I] observed this vehicle stop on Naaman Forest Boulevard and two occupants exited the vehicle. As [I] was passing the stopped vehicle in the right lane, with the vehicle to the immediate right of [me], [I] observed the driver holding an assault rifle and raising it up. The driver was a male wearing dark colored clothing and what appeared to be additional equipment on his chest, like a tactical vest. At this point, [I] heard many shots fired. As [I] drove forward, with the vehicle to the rear right of [me], [I] looked over [my] right shoulder and observed a police officer shooting in the direction of the stopped vehicle. As [I] quickly drove away eastbound, [I] continued to hear shots fired until [I] was stopped by police officers on Naaman Forest Boulevard.

Première photo prise à 6:49 en allant vers l’ouest. Il affirme ne pas suivre de véhicule à ce moment.

Deuxième photo prise à 6:50 en allant vers l’est. Il dit qu’il suivait une voiture qui conduisait lentement et de manière indécise, mais on ne la voit pas sur cette photocopie de mauvaise qualité.

### Observations sur ces deux témoignages :

On remarque que le témoignage de l’agent (UCE-1) est pris hors-contexte, et ne mentionne donc pas les deux photos. Il est extrait d’une déposition, un FD-302, qui est un rapport généré par le FBI pour un événement à caractère de témoignage potentiel (selon les mots de l’agent Stuart Whitson, responsable de l’enquête sur Simpson et Soofi, pendant son témoignage, qui est disponible ici: [https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.929139.264.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.929139.264.0.pdf)).

Ici, on peut trouver une version complète du témoignage de l’agent UCE-1, l’agent infiltré qui avait pris contact avec Erick Hendricks et Elton Simpson (Il est interrogé sous un pseudonyme, et déguisé au procès pour ne pas être reconnu): [https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.929139/gov.uscourts.azd.929139.505.2.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.azd.929139/gov.uscourts.azd.929139.505.2.pdf)

Ce dernier témoignage est très précis et décrit en détail les procédures de contact des agents infiltrés en général, ainsi que ses interactions spécifiques avec les différents suspects.

![path_fbi.png](Position%20de%20l%E2%80%99agent%20infiltre%CC%81%20au%20moment%20de%20la%20fusi%208a7254f7cda24bb79ee08f9818c87fe7/path_fbi.png)

Il explique avoir pris la première photo en allant vers l’ouest, en ayant l’entrée du parking sur sa gauche, à 6:49. Puis, aux alentours de l’intersection mentionnée plus haut, il a fait demi tour, et se dirigeant vers l’est, a capturé la deuxième photo avec l’entrée du parking sur sa droite. Sur la deuxième photo, on ne voit pas le véhicule des attaquants - pourtant, les témoignages s’accordent sur le fait qu’il suivait à ce moment leur voiture, se situant à quelques dizaines de mètres derrière eux. Ils se sont arrêtés sur la droite devant l’entrée et sont sortis de leur voiture, au moment même ou l’agent UCE-1 dépassait l’entrée en question - il affirme avoir vu la fusillade par derrière son épaule droite, donc, quand il conduisait vers l’est. Il est arrêté aux alentours de l’entrée est du parking, par des officiers qui ont entendu les coups de feu ou été alertés d’une situation en cours, dans les quelques minutes qui suivent l’échange de tirs initial.

### Contacts avec les supérieurs et la police locale avant de partir et sur place

Q : So on May 3, 2015, did you travel to Garland, Texas? 

A : YES

Q : Prior to traveling, did you get -- do any prior
coordination with your superiors?

A : Yes. So with my chain of command and the office I was
working for, which is a separate field office, they approved
up through their highest ranking agent so my chain of
command, the other office I was working for and then the
Dallas field office also has a chain of command and they all
the way up the highest ranking agent in the Dallas field
office also was aware of my travel to Garland, Texas and
approved of it.

…..

Q. And when you got down to Texas, did you link up with
somebody on the scene, law enforcement?

A. Yes. So I was working for another field office, but
they put me in contact with a local FBI agent who was a task
force officer working for the FBI office in Dallas. And he also worked for the Garland Police Department as well.
So he was my immediate point of contact.
And then by Email I was put in contact with the FBI
agent who was also in charge at the event.

### Contacts avec Simpson et Hendricks

Q. Did you make any contact with juba or Elton Simpson?
A. I did not.

…..

Q. So did you continue to communicate with accepted on
Wickr?
A. Yes.

……

A : So I announced that I arrived -- well, that I was
traveling to Garland, Texas and that I got there. You know,
he wanted to know -- he asked a couple times about where I
physically was at.

A. I said, "By the way, I couldn't find the Arizona brother.”

…..

Q. And so did you indicate when you arrived at the event?

A. Yes. The local time was 5:19 p.m. on May 3.

……..

### Positionnement pendant l’événement

Q. So during this actual event, where were you physically
located?
A. I was in a parking lot across the street looking at
the event center. I was placed there -- when I first got to
Dallas, I linked up with this Garland Police Department
officer who also worked full-time for the FBI.
So he drove me around. He showed me the lay of the
land. He explained to me what was happening. I explained
to him what my purpose was for being there and what I
intended to do. And he took me to a parking lot, a spot
where he positioned me and said this was a suitable place
for me to basically just sit there and operate on my phone.
Q. Did you continue to communicate with accepted during
the event?
A. Yes.

…….

A. He told me to buy a ticket and get pictures, or he
said I could maintain distance and just observe.
And if I were to "See that pig Pam, to make my voice
heard against her." And, of course, "voice" is in quotation
marks. And when he said, "That pig Pam," he was referring
to Pamela Geller.

### Reprise de contact avec Hendricks

Q. When did you believe "voice" in quotation marks meant?
A. Well, I was pretty sure it didn't mean literally to
make my voice heard. And so he had some other intention
about what he wanted me to do and it was not verbal.
And so I inferred that he wanted me to attack her, you
know, use violence to target Pamela Geller.

……

Q. Did he start to ask you questions?
A. He did. He wanted to know about the security posture
there, particularly how many police officers, security
officers were there, how big it was, how many people were present.

……

A. And when I said -- what I intended when I said "no
Muslim protester," conventional protesters that were holding
signs, etcetera.
Q. Did he ask about the building itself?
A. Yeah, he wanted to know how big it was and whether or
not it was made of wood.

### Mensonges à Hendricks (pour faire croire qu’il va attaquer?)

Q. What other questions did he ask you?
A. He wanted to know if I observed feds there, who I
believe would be federal law enforcement officers. And he
told me to look very closely. And he asked me if I saw any
snipers.

A. Well, I gave him misinformation to provide law
enforcement with a tactical advantage in the event that a
violent activity did happen.
So I told him "No snipers, no dogs, just small town
cops directing traffic. And no feds," although the FBI did
have a large presence there.

……

Q. And what was he asking now?
A. So he said, "Does hotel have anything overlooking that
place?"
So I told him that I was positioned near a hotel
across the street from the event.
And so he was asking me if I could basically use, you
know, the hotel as a place to have a vantage point for
observation.

A. Then he said, "What you got with you."
And so I understood this question that he was asking,
what did I physically have with me. And I inferred that he
was asking me what kind of weapon did I have with me.

A. I said simply "Tools of the trade."
Q. And what was his response?
A. Then he said "LOL," and then to offer some
clarification and what I physically had with me, I said,
"Not a small hand tool."

### Planification d’une attaque factice avec Hendricks

A. So he said that "The people doing the drawing and
hosting and observing are the ones that needed to protest
against." Meaning, he thought that they should be the
target of the protest.
Q. And what did you tell him?
A. I just gave him some additional observations, not a
lot of foot traffic, but everyone is inside the event center
at the time. And then I told him that the event was going
to be ending at 7:00 which was about 30 minutes from that
time.

A. So, you know, I described that I was on the outside
and everyone else was on the inside, and that a ticket was
required. It was a closed event. Closed to the public.
And he said, "Yeah, they are there, but you can voice
your concerns to the hosts after their detail is gone,"
which I understood that after the event was over and
everyone would be leaving the interior of the event center,
they would go back out to the parking lot, they would go to
their cars, and at that point at the end of the event, if
Pamela Geller had a security detail with her, then I should
wait until the -- until that detail, which I understood to be a security detail, would be gone

A. He said that "They will be outside yapping their
mouths and thanking the pigs."

…..

A. He said, "I can't believe there are no other Muslims
there at least with signs, SMH," which I understood to mean
shaking my head.

A. "There are more ways to skin a chicken. They expect
protest."

…..

Q. Did you reference yourself being a lion?
A. I did. I said that the law enforcement officers
"Don't realize that there's a lion staring them down from
behind the tall grass in the woods." And I was referring to
myself.
Q. And while all of this is going on, are you still
physically located at the event?
A. Just across the street from it, yes. But I wanted to
give him the impression that I was a tool of his and I was
postured to do what he wanted me to do.

…..

A. So he responded with the same response that terrorists
use when conducting a terrorist attack which is, "Allah
akbar." He spelled that phrase as A-L-L-A-H, A-K-B-A-R.
That means God is great.

…..

A. So when he said he wished that "I could take their
photos." I told him that I'm going to see how close I can
get. That basically I'm going in.
And I conveyed to him that I was terminating our
conversation. I used the capital letters at the bottom.
That's the standard way for terminating a conversation. So
he knew that that was going to be the last time he was going
to hear from me at the conclusion of that conversation.
So, in other words, he knew that I was going to leave
my position and go into the event, get close to the event.

…..

A. So when he knew that I was going in, he told me, he
gave me another piece of advice. And he said, "You may see
her get into a car to go to airport or catch a flight,
etcetera."
What I understood that, he was giving me some last minute advice for how I could best locate Pamela Geller.

### Conduite autour du centre et fusillade

A. So I terminated the conversation with him, giving him
the impression that I was going in.
Before I -- before I physically moved, I called my
point of contact, again, who was the task force officer,
Garland Police Department officer assigned to the FBI.
And I asked for his permission if I could leave my
place, do a drive by of the convention center and take
pictures of it as I was driving, which I could later use for
future conversations.
Q. And does this show -- is this an accurate depiction of
the aerial layout of the event center?
A. Yes.
Q. And also the roads around it on May 3, 2015?
A. Yes.
Q. Where were you going to drive?

A. So looking at this picture, I was in the kind of top right corner in a parking lot, which you can't see in the picture. But I was, again, in the area of the top right corner.
So I drove to the left, down that main road at the top. So from right to left.
Then I turn around and I intended to drive back. And as I was doing my final drive-by of the event center, I was going to take pictures of the event enter and in the process of taking the pictures, I would probably catch a glimpse of the police checkpoints, and then I intended in the future to say, I was going into execute the attack; however, I encountered these police checkpoints and I will couldn't do it. I just waived off the attack."
Q. Before you go any further, can you just use your finger and actually touch the screen and trace the road you were just talking about?
A. Sure, so when I started moving in my car, I drove this way and I was going down a hill and I did -- I looped back around and came back up in that direction.
Q. Now, when you drove down on your first pass, were you behind any cars?
A. No. Not that I recall.
Q. What happened when you got to the end of that road and made the turn around you just described?
A. So I drove down a ways, drove downhill. I then turned left into an empty parking lot to turn
turned around and just came back. When I came back on the road, I ended up behind a
vehicle. There was a vehicle right in front of me. I was driving behind that vehicle. That vehicle was driving slow. You know, it was driving in an abnormal way. And I remember thinking to myself that I would like to pass this car because they're just getting in my way and they're not -- they're driving slower than the speed limit. And the nature of their driving, I remember thinking to myself it seemed like an indecisive driver or perhaps like a drunk driven or someone not driving normally.
And I wanted to pass them; however, I really couldn't just by the nature of the road so I was kind of stuck behind a slow driver. And then we came up the hill and we encountered the first access point into the parking lot for the convention center.
And then -- would you like me to describe --
Q. Well, if you could stop there for just a moment. What I would first like to do is pull up Government's Exhibit 109. Do you recognize -- actually let's do 110 first.
First, do you recognize Government's Exhibit 110?
A. Yes, I do. So this picture was taken with the convention center to my left. And this picture was taken during my first drive-by, just came right out of the hotel parking lot and convention center on my left.
Q. And what is that, if we can zoom in where there some orange things in the center?
A. Yeah. So there's just orange traffic cones with what appears to be two or three officers there. And they had like a security checkpoint. And that was just one of the two access points into the parking lot.
Q. And is this photo a fair and accurate depiction of
what you saw on May 3, 2015?
A. Yes.
Q. Again, did you take this photo?
A. Yes.
Q. If we could bring up Government's Exhibit 109. What is Exhibit 109?
A. So I had turned around and was coming back to do my second drive-by of the convention center. And I took this picture, which is the same police checkpoint, which is also the first access point into the parking lot for the convention center.
And the car I was describing that I was kind of stuck behind driving behind was off to kind of the center left of the picture frame. And it was still in front of me.
So right about where you have the cursor.
Q. And can we enlarge sort of this section, please, over to the left center? Do you see what appears to be a shadow of anything along the left side?
A. Yeah, and I suspect that that little small dark shade of a color on the pavement of the street is actually the shadow cast by the car that was in front of me.
Q. And is this also a fair and accurate depiction of what you saw on May 3 of 2015?
A. Yes, that is exactly what I saw.
Q. And can we please go to Government's Exhibit 71, again? Where on this overhead map were those photos we just saw, where did those take place?
A. Right, so I was taking pictures of this access point to the parking lot.
Q. So what happened as you drove up behind this car next to that access point?
A. So I observed the car pull off slightly to the side, to the right on the road. And then I saw the doors open. I saw two men jump out of the vehicle with assault rifles and opening fire and engaging the officers at that police checkpoint.
Q. About how far away were you when this happened?
A. Maybe one or two car lengths behind them. And as they pulled off to the side of the road to stop and get out, I was then trying to pass the car. So I observed this while driving past them, you know, exiting the vehicle and opening fire with assault rifles.
Q. Did you expect that to happen?
A. Nope.
Q. What was your immediate reaction?
A. My immediate reaction was to get out of the immediate area because there was a fire fight. There was a shooting that was occurring between the police officers and the shooters, the attackers. And my instincts trained that I need to do something in an official capacity to respond to a crime that I'm observing.
I had no means to physically interdict the shooting.
I had no weapon with me. My vehicle was at a point where it was passed the area of the attack so it wasn't like I could use my forward momentum of the vehicle to, you know, interdict the attackers. That physically was not possible.
And so my instinct, the best I can do right now is I can report what I'm seeing to report to law enforcement. And I reached for my phone and I began to place an emergency phone call from my phone as I was very quickly driving away from the scene of the crime.
Q. What happened?
A. I was very quickly stopped by many police officers, jumping into the road, and halting my vehicle.
Q. Were you dressed in your role at that time?
A. Yes.
*Q. So would you have appeared to be possibly one of the attackers?
A. I could be. I very well could be perceived by the officers that were stopping me because I was literally right next to the attackers at the time. And then as they jumped out of their vehicle, I was speeding off in* mine. And so the officers that observed this event happening and then seeing me immediately leaving the scene could be suspicious that I was involved.
Q. So what ultimately happened after you were pulled over?
A. So I was detained. He was taken out of my vehicle and treated like I was, you know, a suspect, and they were just securing the area. And I was, you know, handcuffed and detained and put in the back of a police vehicle.
Q. Did you later learn who the two men were who jumped out of the car with guns?
A. Yep.
Q. Who were they?
A. It was Elton Simpson and Nader Soofi.
