# Z32 d'Avi Mograbi

Z32 is a documentary film directed by Avi Mograbi that explores the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the story of a former Palestinian prisoner, Ziad Bakri. The film follows Bakri as he attempts to seek justice for the torture he experienced while in Israeli custody.

Throughout the film, Mograbi uses Bakri's story as a vehicle to explore broader themes related to the conflict, including questions of identity, power, and justice. The film also features interviews with Israeli soldiers and officials, as well as Palestinian activists and intellectuals.

One of the key strengths of Z32 is its ability to humanize both sides of the conflict, presenting a nuanced and complex portrait of the individuals caught up in the ongoing struggle. Mograbi's use of humor and irony also helps to lighten the mood at times, providing a much-needed break from the intense subject matter.

Overall, Z32 is a powerful and thought-provoking film that offers a unique perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. By giving voice to those who are often marginalized in the mainstream media, Mograbi has created a work that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging.
