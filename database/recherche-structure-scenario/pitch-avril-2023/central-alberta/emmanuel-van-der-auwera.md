Emmanuel Van Der Auwera is a Belgian artist who works in a variety of media, including video, sculpture, and installation. Born in 1982, he studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp before earning a Master of Fine Arts from the Piet Zwart Institute in Rotterdam.

Van Der Auwera's work often explores the intersection of technology and culture, using a critical lens to examine the ways in which digital tools shape our understanding of the world. His videos, for example, often splice together found footage from the internet to create surreal, unsettling narratives that comment on our relationship to technology.

In addition to his video work, Van Der Auwera has also created numerous sculptural installations. These pieces often incorporate found objects and materials, such as discarded electronics or industrial equipment, which he recontextualizes to create new meanings and associations.

Van Der Auwera's work has been exhibited widely in Europe and the United States, including at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. He has also received a number of awards and grants, including the Prix de la Jeune Peinture Belge in 2011 and the HAP Grieshaber Prize in 2017.

Overall, Emmanuel Van Der Auwera is a talented and thought-provoking artist whose work challenges us to think critically about the role of technology in our lives.
