In retrospect, that freak was insanely prolific. He posted on IMDB numerous times every day and apparently it was just one of dozens of sites he frequented daily. He was a rude oddball on IMDB but Madotsuki persona was one of the more benign of his many aliases. I wonder how many of the white knights that defended "her" on the old site know who madotsuki really is now?

It was one of several boards I visited pretty regularly. I participated in numerous October Challenges as well. I remember one of the earlier challenges I took part in was attacked by Madotsuki the Dreamer. He somehow deleted the progress thread with only a few days remaining in october. If you didn't have a list of your watched movies somewhere other than that thread you were screwed. Considering all the actual federal crimes that kid committed, I guess it's not that big of a deal but it was very annoying at the time. I'm glad he's in federal prison until 2028.

Who the hell is Madotuski the Dreamer?
A poster on Film General. (did you not post there?) The guy with the profile picture of some anime girl. A very strange and disturbed individual. He claimed to be an asexual and hated humanity.

From what I recall (someone can correct me if I get some facts wrong), he was chatting with like would-be terrorists online, trying to get them to commit terrorists acts in public. He even found some schematics or something for a bomb on the internet and sent it them. One of these people was like an undercover FBI guy or whatever and he was then arrested.

I bickered with that sociopath numerous times on IMDB.  It's unsettling that his "trolling" actually incited other nutcases to try and commit terrorism.  It also resulted in 2 crazed muslims being shot to death.  Granted the deaths of 2 psychos that were trying to kill people is no big loss but but it's still creepy to think that goofball caused it.

NONE of those people have anything on easily the craziest and most dangerous IMDb troll ever.  Joshua Ryne Goldberg aka Madotsuki the Dreamer aka moon metroplolis and also had a variety of names on a lot of sites.   He was insanely prolific and created notorious personas ranging from white supremacists to Islamic terrorists to transgender activist to you name it.  He was responsible foe controversial sub reddits like coon town and   "Philosophy of Rape", a subreddit that advocated corrective rape against "whores and feminazis", and offered tips on how to do so without getting caught.

He was actually responsible for convincing 2 Islamist's to stage a terrorist attack and providing bomb instructions with the intentions of tipping off the FBI before they acted but both were killed before he could so.  He was eventually traced by the FBI and arrested.  The guy was on IMDb daily and still had time to post on countless other sites using dozens of handles and personas.  I bickered with him many times as did others on IMDb and was one of the last people to do so the day he was arrested.

Yeah, that shit he pulled was insane. I knew him from the ysh227 days because he took it upon himself (for whatever reason) to drive that guy off of IMDb. He was known as MetropolisForever then, and followed ysh227 everywhere across IMDb. I think he was also a reg on the Sandbox when it was loaded with pre-teens from 2006 to 2008. He didn't seem to have a life outside of IMDb, because he'd post hundreds of times a day. Eventually he stopped posting on the same boards I frequented, like the Video Game, Sandbox and Soapbox boards (unless of course he changed his name and usual demeanor), and it would be years until I encountered him again. But a few of my friends often came into contact with him, and none of them had anything good to say about him, and this was long before he went completely crazy.

According to those who monitored his house in the month leading up to his arrest, he spent so much time on the internet that he never once went outside. He should serve a very, very long time behind bars for all that he did online.

He was trying to play one side against the other, in the hope that he'd trigger some sort of uprising, race war or terrorist attack. That's what I believe. It really is horrifying to think how far he had extended himself in order to fulfill that objective of his. Had he not been arrested, he would've eventually succeeded in causing something. He would've had a field day with BlackLivesMatter in 2016, the Presidential Election, and last week's protests in Charlottesville and other places.

Makes you wonder just how many others like him there must be that are still out there...

OT: You guy remember Madotsuki the Dreamer?

He was the film general member who pretended to be a jihad and convinced two Muslims to attack a 9/11 memorial event which led to them being shot dead by the police. Turned out he was a white kid and got caught by the FBI, just seen he got sentenced to ten years in death and when he gets out he gets a lifetime supervison lol.

He was also if I remember correctly MetropolisForever - dozens if not hundreds of accounts just with variations of that name. He spent a LOT of energy just reporting threads and getting them deleted - usually popular and non-controversial threads.

Joshua Ryne Goldberg (born May 14, 1995) is an American terrorist,[1] convicted of attempting a bombing on the 14th anniversary of the September 11 attacks,[2] while posing as an Islamic terrorist affiliated with ISIS.[3][4][5]

Goldberg first received law-enforcement and media attention under his Twitter handle "Australi Witness" following the Curtis Culwell Center attack, a terrorist attack on a Garland, Texas exhibit featuring images of Muhammad in May 2015, in which two assailants died in a shootout with police.[2] The "Australi Witness" persona, had, posing as a Perth jihadist, called for an attack on, and posted maps of, the center where the exhibit was taking place, praised the jihadist attackers in its aftermath, and was retweeted by one of the assailants before the attack.[6] He also claimed credit for the attack.[7][8][9][10]

Goldberg also planned terrorist attacks in Australia.[8][10][11][12]

Initially charged with distributing information about bomb-making techniques in connection with a planned attack on a 2015 Kansas City 9/11 memorial event,[13] Goldberg's trial was suspended pending efforts by doctors to return him to competence[14] after it emerged that he had a history of mental illness.[15]

On December 20, 2017, Goldberg pleaded guilty to federal charges of attempted malicious damage and destruction by an explosive of a building.[2][16] On June 25, 2018, Goldberg was sentenced to ten years in federal prison and lifetime supervision.[17]

Yeah, he’d pretend he was a chick...bet he’s not *pretending* anymore.

DM twitter : 

Hi, sorry for responding late, I haven't been checking notifications lately. Not much I can tell you, I'm afraid. Goldberg was creating sock accounts to mock dead posters and I called him on it on the old IMDB message boards. He then came onto the horror board under a different username but I knew it was him from his style and called him on it. He used to send the occasional abusive private message. I also stupidly had a contact email address in my old profile, which he spammed with beastiality porn, causing me to delete the address. He then followed me onto another horror forum and that was about that. I told him he'd get himself in trouble one day as he struck me as quite disturbed and sure enough, he did. Her's due for release next year and will probably be banned from using the internet as part of his parle, I reckon. Sorry I couldn't be of more help and again excuse the late reply, cheers.
