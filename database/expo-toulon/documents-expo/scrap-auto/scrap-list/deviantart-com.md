Now I feel like I have to take all of my "Politics" and "Movies & TV" threads and re-post them here...

They were things like "Does Pornography Reduce Humans to Slabs of Meat?", "Could It Be Possible to 'Manufacture' Humans?", "The Ethics of Eating Meat", "' ositive' Racial Discrimination?", ect.

No, I made a bunch of threads on the politics forum and the movies & TV a few weeks ago. Go read them. ALSO: Since I'm actually Jesus Christ, anyone who hates me is going to Hell.

Does the concept of "nothing" really even exist? And, if it did, how could we be having a conversation about it? Perhaps the concept exists, but nothing does not?

Just to prove how much Family Guy sucks, I have taken the liberty of writing my own episode:

Peter: Hey, Lois... Lois: Yes?

Peter: Remember that time I vomited Jerry Lewis out of my butt? CUT TO: Jerry Lewis being vomited out of Peter's butt.

Jerry Lewis: Hi, I'm Jerry Lewis, and your butt stinks! CUT TO: Griffin house.

Television: We now return to our special report on local gay guy Peter Griffin. Peter: NO WAY!

Peter: I AM NOT GAY!

Lois: Well, I don't know, honey, you DID lick Mr. T's hip wearing a sombrero. CUT TO: Peter licking Mr. T's hip wearing a sombrero.

Mr. T: I pity the fool that can't lick me right! CUT TO: Chris' room.

Chris: Dad, are you really a gay? Because God says that's bad. Peter: No, son, God was gay himself.

CUT TO: God staring at Jesus.

God: Well, are we gonna do this, or what? CUT TO: Meg and Chris' school.

Student: So, Meg, I heard your dad was gay. That's cool. Meg: Really?

Student: NO!

[all laugh at Meg]

CUT TO: Outside the Griffins' house.

Quagmire: So, Peter, now that you're a queer, does that mean I can tear through your wife's carpet all I want!? Giggity giggity!

Peter: I am not a queer! I am perfectly straight, thank you very much! Quagmire: Whatever you say! Giggity giggity goo!

Peter: Hey, screw you, man! Quagmire: Hell no! I don't do men! CUT TO: Peter and Lois in bed.

Lois: Peter, I'm concerned about your increasing gayness. It's not healthy.

Peter: Oh, come on, just because that attractive Hitler look-alike on TV said I'm gay does NOT mean I'm gay! Lois: I don't know, Peter... remember that time we went to MC Hammer's retirement home?

CUT TO: MC Hammer's retirement home.

Peter: So, why are you called "MC Hammer"? Do you like to get hammered up your butthole or what? Lois: Peter!

The rest of the episode would be finished by a group of mentally-challenged first-graders. After all... who else is going to give them a chance?

What are your posts characterized by? How do people know "oh, that's a [insert name here] post"?

Well, people know me for being unpredictable. Sometimes, I'll post a series of incredibly weird, incoherent, and nonsensical rants. One moment, I'm the nicest person in the world. The next moment, I hate everyone. I'm known for my long, long ramblings, my threads about politics, philosophy, religion, and so forth, my re-posting of the same threads over and over again, and, most of all, my lists. I am the King of Lists.

I've seen all the episodes of the original Nekojiru Gekijou, but I've never seen the Cat Soup OVA.

Wrong.

I hate generalizations. I never made a single generalization in my post.

[Metropolisforever](https://www.deviantart.com/metropolisforever) commented on [Your Favorite MPAA "Moments"](https://www.deviantart.com/forum/entertainment/movies/1399606) by [Metropolisforever](https://www.deviantart.com/metropolisforever) [Dec 20, 2009](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/18/1399606/1305577196)

The MPAA can be a real pain in the ass. Sure, it's way better than the BBFC (the UK's "Big Brother" film rating force, which has the right to edit or ban anything they don't like, and which is involuntary), but the MPAA still has much to criticize about it.

What are your favorite "MPAA moments"? Some examples:

1. Midnight Cowboy is submitted for rating and receives an X rating. After winning Best Picture, it is submitted again and receives an R rating without any cuts (although the MPAA website claims it was "edited", this is, as a matter of fact, not the case. It was indeed re-rated R without any edits whatsoever).
2. Baby Doll is approved by the Hays Code in 1955. After causing much controversy for years, it is submitted for rating in 1969 and receives an "R" rating - despite the fact that the film contains absolutely no profanity, nudity, or violence, and, in fact, there had been "G" rated films with far more graphic content.
3. Bad Education - a foreign film involving gay sexuality - contains a brief oral sex scene in which the penis is hidden by the transsexual woman's head (a man who became a woman, just to be clear). The film receives an NC-17 rating for "a scene of explicit sexuality". The Hangover - a Hollywood comedy about four straight men and their various sexual encounters - contains an oral sex scene in which an elderly woman gives a blowjob to one of the men and his penis can actually be seen. The film receives an R rating for "pervasive language, sexual content including nudity, and some drug material."
4. Dice Rules, Nothin' Goes Right, and Centrespread rated NC-17 for sexual dialogue. Clerks almost suffers the same fate, but Miramax appealed the decision and the film was rated R instead.
5. Santa Sangre (1989) - a Mexican art film - is rated NC-17 for "several scenes of extremely explicit violence." Meanwhile, Hollywood's Nightmare on Elm Street 5 and Friday the Thirteenth 8 are released with R ratings and nobody cares.
6. The Wild Bunch (1969) - which was given an R rating with no cuts in 1969 - is re-submitted in 1994 and receives an NC-17 rating for violence. Never mind the fact that Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction are given "R" ratings with no problems - The Wild Bunch is apparently so violent that it must be given an NC-17. The decision was appealed, however; it was eventually re-released with an R rating.
7. Waiting for Guffman is given an R rating in 1996 for one use of the F-word. Countless PG-13 films have used the word more than once. Beetlejuice (which uses the word twice) and Spaceballs both have the F-word in their dialogue and received PG ratings (no, not even PG-13). Later on, Gunner Palace uses the word 42 times and The Hip Hop Project uses the word 17 times - both films receive PG-13 ratings after appeals.
8. In 1984, the PG-13 rating is introduced. The Woman in Red is one of the first 3 films to be rated "PG-13" - it contains full- frontal nudity.
9. Orgazmo (an independent film by the South Park team) is given an NC-17, despite some very tame sexual content, mostly just dialogue. Two years later, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut - a Hollywood film with very, very extreme levels of sexual content, including an actual photographic depiction of a penis - is given an "R" rating with no problems.
10. Coming Soon - described as a female American Pie, but with much, much more tame sexuality - is given an NC-17, despite the fact that there is virtually no on-screen sexuality whatsoever. In fact, the director was expecting a PG-13. The same year, American Pie (which is infinitely more graphic) is passed with an "R" rating without any problems. The difference? American Pie is about boys. Coming Soon is about girls.

[Metropolisforever](https://www.deviantart.com/metropolisforever) commented on [The Ethics of Eating Meat](https://www.deviantart.com/forum/community/politics/1399603) by [Metropolisforever](https://www.deviantart.com/metropolisforever) [Dec 20, 2009](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/18/1399603/1305570842)

I'd like all of you carnivores to answer this question for me: what is the moral difference between eating a pig and eating a dog? Well, there really is no moral difference. Both animals have the same intelligence (in fact, pigs have greater intelligence), both of them have the same capacity to feel love, and both can feel pain equally. No, it's not an issue of morals. It's an issue of culture. Our culture considers eating a pig to be acceptable, but eating a dog to be savage and disgusting - despite the fact that there is absolutely no moral difference between the two. If our culture considered eating dogs to be acceptable, we'd all be chowing down on our dog-burgers this very second. Who knows? We might even be eating dog while taking our pigs for a walk.
